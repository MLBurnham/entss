1," News from Congressman Brian Mast HONORING THE HEROES OF THE BENGHAZI ATTACK   - A decade has passed since terrorists led a mob that attacked American diplomatic compounds in Benghazi, Libya. This senseless attack killed four Americans who were defending the United States' consulate. U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens was the first United States Ambassador to lose his life in the line of duty since 1979. United States Foreign Service officer and Air Force veteran Sean Smith, as well as combat-decorated Navy SEALs Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty also gave their lives in defense of our nation. Last month, Congress passed a bipartisan bill I wrote to posthumously award these four Americans the Congressional Gold Medal, which is the highest civilian honor the Congress has to offer. This recognition is long overdue for four heroes who gave their last breath fighting to advance the cause of freedom around the globe, and I cannot think of more deserving recipients of the Gold Medal.

5," News From Congressman Ben Cline Sixth District Perspectives with Congressman Ben Cline A Time for Reflection and a Look Ahead to a Bright Future The Christmas and holiday season is a time of celebration, and the New Year a time of reflection. Although we are looking forward to the 2023 legislative calendar and to tackling the critical issues confronting our Nation, I wanted to take a moment to update you on my office's efforts on your behalf these past twelve months. It's always great to hear more about the issues most concerning to folks from a variety of sectors across our district, and great Commonwealth. In my D.C. office, I enjoyed meeting with members of the Virginia Restaurant and Travel Association and listening to their views on how federal policies have affected their industry. Working for You While my D.C. office handles the legislative issues I tend to in the House of Representatives, as well as my responses to your legislative inquiries, my four District offices are located in Harrisonburg, Staunton, Lynchburg, and Roanoke. There, my staff assists constituents in communicating with federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Internal Revenue Service. My office and I also handle congressional nominations to one of four United States Service Academies, in addition to an array of other services carried out by my D.C. and District offices, such as offering Capitol flag sales, D.C. tours, and more listed on my website . My team and I have worked hard to serve Virginia's Sixth District, meet with constituents, answer questions, and provide assistance, and the results in 2022 speak for themselves: 73,745 constituent letters, calls, and emails answered 9 in-person Town Halls were held across the district 43 events attended across the district 32 businesses toured across the district 15 schools visited 2,116 constituent cases with federal agencies completed 92 Mobile Office Hours held for constituents to meet directly with my staff During one of my town halls in Page County, I was glad to take constituents' questions and hear their concerns. Legislative Accomplishments In serving on the House Appropriations and Budget Committees, my office was committed to ensuring taxpayer dollars were spent in the best interests of the American people. During the Appropriations full committee mark-up hearings, I offered a total of 15 amendments to improve 7 of the 12 spending bills, and had my language adopted 3 times throughout the process. Throughout the 117th Congress, I was proud to introduce 13 bills, 8 of which were bipartisan. Of that, 3 bills where I served as the lead Republican were passed and signed into law, either as standalone legislation or as part of a larger legislative package: - H.R. 1651 - COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act of 2021 extends existing provisions that provide relief to debtors in bankruptcy, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic. - H.R. 7494 - Small Business Reorganization Technical Corrections Act modifies provisions related to small business reorganization bankruptcies, provides that a small business debtor includes a debtor that is an affiliate of certain publicly traded companies, and authorizes the bankruptcy trustee to operate the business of the debtor if the debtor ceases to be a debtor in possession. - H.R. 8017 - VA Workforce Investment and Expansion Act expands the VA workforce by enhancing VA hiring practices and incentives to better recruit and retain healthcare professionals, and strengthen Veteran access to quality VA healthcare. Additionally, I cosponsored 301 bills that focus on a wide array of issues including, but not limited to, Veterans, healthcare, pro-life, government reform, education, the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, and agriculture. For a full list of legislation I sponsored and/or cosponsored, click here . One of the bills I was most proud to cosponsor and secure a provision in - regarding bolstering VA healthcare hiring practices and expanding access to care, especially for rural areas like ours - was the historic PACT Act . This legislation finally brought justice for, and expanded benefits to, Veterans and their families who were burn pit victims sickened in Iraq and Afghanistan, in addition to Vietnam Veterans exposed to toxic chemicals. Lastly, this year I joined 167 letters pursuant to Congress' constitutional oversight responsibility to ensure Federal agencies are working for the American people. Further, I led and was joined by my colleagues in sending 8 letters to the Biden administration demanding accountability, from ensuring Congress' allocated infrastructure funds are spent on core roads and bridges first rather than Green New Deal priorities, to soliciting immediate answers as to how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will solve the crisis of the near 50,000 illegal immigrants released in six months who received 'Notice to Reports' but failed to re-check in with authorities. Finally, I led in writing to the National Park Service to call for the prioritization of our troops, Veterans, and Gold Star families in accessing some of the most exclusive and scenic views of our national parks, as they earned such privileges. District Travels While what's largely seen on national news platforms centers around the hearings and votes on Capitol Hill, a representative's work in his or her district is the most vital part of the job. The district is where we interact with constituents, local leaders, and small business owners to be able to represent their views in Washington. It's where both the constituents we represent and our loved ones reside. It's the place we call home. First, ahead of the 2023 Farm Bill, I hosted two farm tours in our district. Virginia's Sixth District is the largest agriculture district in the Commonwealth, where farming is the number one industry. I enjoyed speaking with farmers, agriculture industry leaders, and workers in the northern part of the district in the spring, and in the southern part of the district this past fall. Touring Huffman Livestock Margaret Ann Smith Farm in Lexington where they discussed their purchasing and selling of feeder cattle Additionally, I held my annual Higher Education Roundtable at Blue Ridge Community College's Weyers Cave Campus. VA-06 houses more institutions of higher education than almost any other Congressional district in the Nation. These colleges and universities offer a variety of vocational, undergraduate, and graduate programs for students in Virginia and across the country who come to the Sixth District for their education. College and university presidents and leaders joined me there to discuss successes and challenges in higher education, including the need to ease the costs of higher education, without non-college grads bailing out the student loan debt of others. Meeting with VA-06 college and university presidents and academic leaders Engaging with our Nation's future generation of leaders is always a favorite opportunity of mine, whether it be reading to students, talking to government classes, or speaking at school events. I was proud to visit 15 schools throughout the district this year, and look forward to meeting more of our incredible young people this coming year. Talking to students in a government class at Patrick Henry High School in Roanoke One of my privileges as your Representative is to highlight the incredible achievements of VA-06 residents on the House floor. Whether it be high school or college sports championship wins, volunteer and charitable recognitions, or paying tribute to those who have served, I have been proud to recognize constituents' many accomplishments this year. Congratulating retired Master Sergeant Silverine James for the naming of the Salem VAMC Women's Health Clinic in her honor Visiting small and large businesses across the district serves as a reminder that government must not obstruct but foster economic growth. This past year, I had the opportunity to tour 32 local businesses up and down VA-06, like BWXT Technologies in Lynchburg and Modine Manufacturing in their newly renovated Rockbridge facility. All of our hardworking businesses are critical to job creation and economic growth, and I'll continue fighting in Washington to ensure they can thrive. Touring Modine Manufacturing in their newly renovated Rockbridge facility Visiting Deb's Frozen Lemonade in Cave Spring as part of celebrating National Small Business Week One of my greatest honors is meeting with Sixth District Veterans. Whether it be in local VFWs or in large gatherings, such as for Veterans Day, Memorial Day, and 9/11 remembrance ceremonies, it is always a privilege to thank, recognize, and fight for those who fought for us. Honoring and spending some time with Veterans at the Shenandoah County Fairgrounds in Woodstock Greeting Grottoes councilman and Veteran Jim Justis at the Grottoes Veterans Day ceremony Joining Veterans at Chapter 936 of the Vietnam Veterans of America in Edinburg for one of their monthly meetings Meetings with Constituents in Washington Engaging with constituents in the people's House of Representatives and hearing their concerns is always a great reminder of why I came to Washington. I enjoy listening to constituents' views on the issues that are most important to them, and hearing how I can best represent and advocate for their priorities in these very halls. Meeting with representatives of VA-06 Boys & Girls Clubs of America Hosting members of the National Turkey Federation Celebrating faith and freedom at the Bible Museum in Washington with students from Liberty University Thank you for the opportunity to serve as your Congressman.

7," As we enter 2023, I remain grateful for the opportunity to represent Utahns in Washington and help tackle some of the biggest issues facing our great country. To continue being transparent and accountable to you, I've put together a report detailing my efforts in Washington this past year. I had several bills become law this year, including legislation that amplifies the work being done by the State of Utah to save the Great Salt Lake, equips the U.S. to better counter the rise of China, and allows for the completion of the Bonneville Shoreline Trail. I also continued working to address the drought and water issues plaguing communities across Utah. The Romney team assisted with more than 1,600 Utahns with casework claims, responded to more than 81,000 pieces of constituent mail, and met with hundreds of Utahns and businesses throughout the state.

8," A Hui Hou From Team Kahele Congressman Kahele and his senior staff would like to share a video message to thank the constituents and communities throughout the 2nd Congressional District of Hawaiʻi. WATCH HERE U.S. CONGRESSMAN KAHELE'S TERM IN CONGRESS ENDS Hilo, HI -U.S. Congressman Kaialiʻi Kahele's term in the 117th Congress will come to an end the morning of Tuesday, January 3, 2023. Highlighted as the most productive Congress since President Johnson's Great Society accomplishments two generations ago-and under the leadership of President Joe Biden and Democratic control of both chambers of Congress-the 117th Congress delivered historic results for the American people and the State of Hawaiʻi. Major pieces of federal legislation enacted into law include: The American Rescue Plan The Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act The Inflation Reduction Act The CHIPS and Science Act The Honoring our PACT Act The Safer Communities Act The Respect for Marriage Act In addition, Congressman Kahele delivered over $26 million dollars in community project federal funding to Hawaiʻi's 2nd Congressional District to support nonprofits, county and state priority projects, and Federally Qualified Health Centers on every island throughout Hawaiʻi. Only the 18th person to ever serve in Congress representing the State of Hawaiʻi since Statehood, Congressman Kahele's time in elected office comes to an end after serving one term in Congress & two terms in the Hawaiʻi State Senate following the untimely death of his father, the late State Senator Gilbert Kahele. At the conclusion of the 117th Congress, Congressman Kahele will immediately return to full time employment as a Hawaiian Airlines Airbus A330 Captain and continue his service to Hawaiʻi and the Nation as a Lt Colonel in the Hawaiʻi Air National Guard, where he currently is a graduate student in the United States Army War College at Carlisle Barracks in Pennsylvania.

9," Thank you for your support Dear friend, When I was first elected to Congress, I jotted down a list of goals I hoped I would accomplish while serving you. As I cleaned out my office, I came across an old, coffee-stained list, and I couldn't help but smile as I read through the bulleted note. On that list? Building an exceptional constituent service program, securing generous federal funding to support local projects and developing innovative and practical solutions to the real problems people in our region face every day. I'm proud that I never lost sight of what I came to Washington to do. My team was honored for having the best constituent service program of any Democrat in Congress - with more than 6,800 cases closed and more than $5.3 million returned directly to residents. I was the top House Democrat to bring home community project funding to our towns and cities last year and delivered $56 million to improve our communities . Among these investments were $1 million to demolish the former Harrison School in Peoria, $300,000 for a new outpatient behavioral health care clinic at Rosecrance in Freeport and $750,000 for the YMCA of Rock River Valley Equity Center in Rockford. And throughout my five terms, I've championed commonsense, bipartisan legislation - with real results. That includes legislation signed into law that will protect our roadside first responders , provide year-round Pell Grants to students and restore the rights of sexual assault and sexual harassment survivors to seek justice and speak out . While there are many legislative victories I was proud to accomplish, I always kept the people I served back home at the center of everything I did. Our Congressional District is a special place. But its true beauty lies in the heart of our people. I have been privileged to represent some of the most hard-working and passionate individuals - who are the backbone of our nation. I learned many lessons during my time in public service, but one of the most important is that anyone can make a positive difference in the lives of those around them. As I say farewell, I encourage you all to look at the talents you hold and see how you can best serve others. We have been a team for the past 10 years, and I can't thank you enough for placing your trust in me for five terms. It's been my honor to serve you in Congress.

11," Wicker Outlines Conservative Priorities for 2023 Republicans Will Fight Inflation, Support Military, Defend Basic Freedoms As 2023 arrives, lawmakers will return to Washington to kick off the 118th Congress, reflecting the new majorities elected by the American people. Although I was disappointed Republicans did not win the Senate, voters did elect a narrow Republican majority in the House, placing important checks on President Biden and his party. Bills passed in the House will now reflect a more conservative agenda, which includes ending inflation, securing our southern border, strengthening our military, and defending our basic freedoms. Ensuring Peace Through Strength In the new Congress, I will become the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. This position will allow me to play a lead role in meeting the needs of our military. Unfortunately, years of underinvestment have severely hurt our military readiness and ability to prevent conflict. As a result, China has grown more aggressive and the world has become more dangerous. This trend can be reversed, though, if we make the right investments in our security. I intend to use my new role to strengthen our entire military, including by expanding our naval fleet. As Ronald Reagan famously said, the best way to prevent war is ""peace through strength,"" becoming so strong that our adversaries never think of challenging us. Republicans Fight for Middle America During the last two years, Democrats used so-called ""budget reconciliation"" to spend trillions of dollars on liberal priorities - something they will no longer be able to do. They also worked to restrict our Second Amendment rights, tried to enact a federal takeover of our elections, and attempted to impose abortion-on-demand on the entire nation, preventing states like Mississippi from protecting unborn life. With a Republican House, these radical ideas will be blocked in the new Congress as Republicans work to restore healthy governance. After two years of President Biden, our economy is still struggling, and workers and small businesses need continued support. Republicans are committed to preserving the tax cuts we passed in 2017, which have lifted burdens on job creators and led to significant pay increases for workers. We will also work to curb inflation by blocking the left's socialist spending, giving our economy a chance to recover. In addition, Republicans will insist on securing the border, which has descended into chaos under President Biden. And we will declare a national war on fentanyl, a drug that has become the leading cause of death in America. House Republicans will use their new majority to advance these priorities. Holding Biden Accountable Under Democrat control of Congress, President Biden managed to escape accountability for his failures at home and abroad. This will change in 2023 as House Republican committee chairmen will be able to provide more oversight and direction for a conservative agenda. House Republicans will demand answers after a record 2.3 million migrants entered the U.S. illegally this past year. They will also probe the President's foreign policy failures, including his chaotic pullout from Afghanistan in 2021. In addition, House members will investigate credible evidence of corruption by Joe Biden when he was serving as Vice President, which was found on his son Hunter's laptop. Republicans will also continue working to hold Big Tech accountable for their attacks on our free speech and privacy. I am currently pushing for new investigations into Big Tech companies, along with legislation to roll back special protections they enjoy. We will still have to reach bipartisan consensus, but the end of single-party rule in Washington is very good news for the American people.

If you would like to respond to this mailing, click here to send me an email through my official website.*** Congressman Tim Burchett January 2023 Newsletter Update Rep. Burchett looks ahead to changes in the 118th Congress, votes against massive spending bills, and speaks out on the border crisis Hello  , I hope you had a great Christmas and New Year surrounded by loved ones. I wanted to give you an update on what happened in Washington this December. Tim's Top Three As we look ahead to the 118th Congress, Republicans will have the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Here are the top three things I'm looking forward to about that: 1) The People's House will be open -- Over the past couple years, Democrats have restricted the public's access to U.S. House of Representatives and Capitol buildings. Republicans have found this unacceptable, as this is the People's House. In 2023, Republicans are removing a lot of these senseless restrictions so tours will be more widely available and visitors will finally be able to enter office buildings without a staff escort. If you would like to book a tour of the U.S. Capitol, please do not hesitate to reach out to me via email or by calling my Washington office at (202) 225-5435. 2) Government Accountability -- Border mismanagement. Big tech censorship. Botched international policy. Republicans will hold officials in the Biden administration and elsewhere accountable for major wrongdoings that Democrats failed to properly address. 3) Fiscal Responsibility -- Democrats passed far too many multi-trillion dollar spending bills to fund their political agendas, and Americans paid the price -- literally. These reckless bills have spiked inflation and cost the American people more money than ever before. Republicans will fight for more fiscal responsibility to help our economy prosper and keep more money in Americans' pockets. Looking Ahead I joined Wake Up America on Newsmax to discuss my proposed rules for the 118th Congress that would make the work we do in Washington more transparent for the folks who elected us to office. Americans deserve to know what's happening in the People's House. Key Vote: $1.7 Trillion Omnibus FY2023 Spending Bill I voted against the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending package. The Democrats packed it with everything under the sun and expected us to vote on it without getting a chance to read it. You can read my full statement below, and also catch my speech about all the woke garbage that's in the bill. I was cut off during the speech, but it's my job to let Tennesseans and Americans know what's really happening to their tax dollars. Fox and Friends First also brought me onto their show to discuss a program in this omnibus spending package that aids illegal immigrants, as well as China's increased aggression towards Taiwan. You can watch the full interview here or by clicking on the image below: Key Vote: National Defense Authorization Act FY2023 I voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2023, which was packed with woke Democrat priorities that had a price tag of $847.3 billion dollars and didn't properly address our national security issues. You can read my full statement on my vote below: Not only is this wasteful spending unfit for Tennesseans, but the NDAA did not reinstate our servicemembers that have been fired by Biden's Department of Defense for not taking the jab. Watch my interview with Newsmax where I speak on the unlawful COVID-19 vaccine mandate and FY 2023 NDAA by clicking here or on the image below: Border Crisis I gave a speech on the House floor on the liberal media's cover-up of the catastrophe at our southern border and joined FOX Business to discuss this unprecedented crisis. You can watch both these videos below. Governor Bill Lee also announced President Biden and his Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security were going to release illegal immigrants in Tennessee. Our homeland isn't secure with actions and policies like this. You can read my full statement below: Big Tech Censorship: The Twitter Files I joined Fox Business and Newsmax to talk about the unprecedented censorship of conservatives that we saw before an election. When House Republicans take over in January for the new Congress, we're going to call these people to the carpet and hold them accountable for their role in silencing Americans. Tennessee Talks Tennessee Talks featured two great guests this month. You can catch the videos on my official YouTube channel or listen wherever you listen to podcasts! On a special Christmas episode , the North Pole's very own Santa Claus met up with me for a special segment so we could talk about who was on the naughty and nice list! On the second episode , I had a blast sitting down with my good friend Congressman Thomas Massie (KY-04). We talked about liberty, patents, and what really goes on behind the curtains in the swamp.

13," A Most Productive Session of Congress for our Big, Small Town I've often thought that Maine is just one big small town connected by long roads. Well, in the past year or two, those roads have gotten steeper and bumpier as we dealt with an unprecedented pandemic and the resulting economic troubles. As we faced the historic challenges, something impressive happened. We came together and lent a hand to our neighbors wherever we could to keep things running and spirits high. Down in Washington, Congress tried to help Maine communities get through this struggle, so that our state would come out stronger. To do that, we put in the work and set some things into motion that are already helping Maine people. That's why you hired us, after all. The pandemic made something we'd known for a while clear: those roads and networks that connect our big town needed repair, improvements, and expansion - from bridges to broadband. So, while Maine was uniting towards a common purpose, Congress came together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law - legislation that makes generational investments in physical infrastructure, broadband connections, harbors, and the energy grid. These efforts will lay the foundation for Maine's 21st century economy and make sure even the most rural areas aren't left behind. Over the last two years, as we drove up and down our state, you couldn't help but see storefronts in trouble and prices rising as the economy struggled through a global recession. And again, while you focused your efforts on getting through the difficult times, Congress took meaningful action. We passed the American Rescue Plan in 2021, which enabled Gov. Mills and the state of Maine to better meet the health and economic difficulties of the pandemic. At a critical moment it expanded healthcare efforts to confront COVID and invested in the state to keep the economy in far better shape than most others nationwide. Congress didn't stop there. This year, we took even more concrete steps to cut costs, create jobs, and provide more affordable, cleaner energy. The bipartisan CHIPS Act will bring home the manufacturing of the technical components known as ""chips"" that are used in everything these days - from smartphones to microwaves to cars - and in doing so reduce prices and create good American jobs. We also passed the Inflation Reduction Act to lower healthcare costs, allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, and cut energy bills with new rebates for things like heat pumps and solar panels. Beyond these major investments, we also passed vital legislation to improve the day-to-day lives of Maine people and Americans nationwide. On a bipartisan basis, we expanded health care for veterans exposed to toxic chemicals, stabilized the Postal Service we rely on, strengthened protections for marriage equality, supported Ukraine as it fights for its independence against the Russian invasion, and delivered millions in federal investments to projects up and down our state. So, as Maine worked to get through hard times, Congress took steps to support our state. We're already starting to see brighter days ahead and I'm proud to have played a small part down here. It's a true privilege to listen to you, work with you, and build a brighter future for all the incredible people up and down the roads that connect our big small town. Protecting Maine's Lobster Industry Maine's lobster industry has been a signature part of our state's economy and identity for generations. For as long as Maine's lobstermen and women have been on the water, they've demonstrated their commitment to maintaining and protecting a sustainable fishery in the Gulf of Maine. They have invested in countless precautionary measures to protect North Atlantic right whales, including removing more than 30,000 miles of line from the water and switching to weaker, breakaway rope to prevent whales from being entangled. The fact is - there has never been a right whale death attributed to Maine lobster gear. But despite our industry's good stewardship and work to protect right whales, our lobstermen and women are now faced with punitive regulations that wouldn't meaningfully protect the endangered species, but would threaten the livelihoods of Maine families and small businesses. It's unfair and wrong. As Maine's leaders, we have always said that we will pursue any and all policy solutions to protect our hardworking lobstermen and women along Maine's coast. That is why I worked with the Maine delegation and Governor Mills to include a provision in the annual spending bill that will enable our lobster fishery to continue to operate and pause the devastating regulations. Without this provision, Maine's iconic industry could be facing a complete shutdown and the ripple effects across our state would have been widespread. Our provision, which relies upon the expertise of the professionals at the Maine Department of Marine Resources, is a commonsense bipartisan measure to support the hard working people of Maine's most sustainable fishery, and I'm proud we were able to get it in the bill. Securing Jobs at Bath Iron Works For sixty-two years in a row, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have come together to pass an annual defense bill that focuses on bolstering American national security and improving the lives of servicemembers and their families. This year, I'm proud to say Congress has done it again. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) boosts Maine's economy by authorizing one of the largest-ever multi-year procurement of DDG-51 destroyers, which Bath Iron Works can compete to build, bringing important stability to the Maine shipyard's planning, and allowing them to scale up their production in the years to come. These ships - known as the workhorse of the Navy - are absolutely critical to our national security, and are an important economic driver for Maine communities. This year's legislation also strengthens the backbone of our national defense, including key provisions to ensure our nation can counter growing and rapidly changing threats in Europe and the Pacific. It contains new authorizations to sanction Russia over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and support for the brave Ukrainians fighting for their sovereignty. This bill improves our defensive and offensive hypersonic capabilities, bolsters key cyber defenses, and will modernize how we assess the capabilities of our enemies and allies alike. Most importantly, the legislation makes significant investments in the essential core of our Armed Forces - our brave men and women in uniform. Along with a 4.6% pay raise to help servicemembers keep up with rising costs of living, the NDAA will study the suicide epidemic in our military so the Department is better equipped to address this urgent crisis. All told, this bill will make our country safer, strengthen our economy, and support the men and women who serve. To read more about Maine-specific provisions included in the NDAA, click here . A Forward-Thinking Annual Spending Bill Every year Congress puts together an annual spending bill which keeps the federal government open and working for Maine people and Americans across the country. This year Congress once again passed forward-thinking, bipartisan legislation which will support Maine jobs, increase affordability for working families, and invest in our national security. The bill includes funding for shipbuilding priorities at BIW, for supporting our veterans and active duty troops, for protecting and maintaining our National Parks, for supporting our children and families with education and nutrition assistance, and for making housing more affordable. The bill also includes the Electoral Count Act to provide democratic protections for the peaceful transfer of power. This is essential to the foundation of our democracy. There is so much worth celebrating in the bill, and all told, I'm grateful to see this bipartisan product pass Congress and be signed into law. I am eager to continue working across the aisle with my colleagues in the coming year on more policies that help Maine people. Congressionally-Directed Spending for 140 Maine Projects In addition to the big picture benefits of the annual spending bill, we're starting to see tangible impacts in all corners of our state. Working with my colleagues in both chambers, I'm proud to have secured $250,083,018 for 140 Maine projects through Congressionally-Directed Spending (CDS) requests included in the bipartisan Fiscal Year 2023 omnibus appropriations package. The funding will be used for projects like building new fire stations or conducting road repairs by a broad range of state, local, and nonprofit organizations. Maine people have always looked out for each other, and the 140 nonprofits and local governments receiving these funds are no different - they have proven track records of success and service in our communities and will use this support to expand and improve their efforts. I'm grateful that Congress approved so many of my CDS requests, and deeply appreciate all of the Maine organizations who submitted projects for consideration. I look forward to seeing these investments improve Maine people's lives. You can see all the projects near you on our interactive map HERE . Protecting the Foundation of Democracy In January 2021, our country encountered one of our biggest threats to our system of government - an attempt by the sitting President to overturn the will of the people. A violent insurrection to stop the electoral count can never happen again. That's why the bipartisan Electoral Count Reform Act is the most important piece of legislation we passed this Congress. It protects the foundation of our entire democratic system: the peaceful transfer of power. After these outrageous attempts to overturn a free and fair election exposed dangerous vulnerabilities in the antiquated 1887 Electoral Count Act, this bill was essential to disarm the ticking timebomb at the heart of our system of government. Now, as some continue to raise doubts about our electoral system, the bill ensures the ECA can never again be used as a weapon by disappointed candidates. The Senate took a necessary, historic, and commonsense step to remove dangerous ambiguities from presidential elections and strengthen America's democratic process. While I continue to look for ways to better protect our elections, this effort will further guarantee that the will of the voters cannot be undermined once they've made their choices. And for that, I am thankful. Giving Back on 'Inside Maine' Podcast Maine's nonprofits and volunteers have always stepped up to support our neighbors and communities in need. On Inside Maine this month , I spoke with leaders across our state who shared how volunteerism has helped Maine communities weather the economic and social challenges that unfolded over the past year. In the face of daunting obstacles, these leaders have responded with energy, joy, and compassion - bringing light in dark moments. We discussed the affordable housing crisis and the need for organizations to cut through red tape and bureaucracy to connect vulnerable Maine people with food banks, shelters, and other nonprofits. I first spoke with Charley Martin-Berry, the director of the Community Caring Collaborative (CCC) . She leads the collaboration of state, local, and tribal partners working to improve outcomes for vulnerable Washington County community members. Charley is working hard to ensure that Washington County residents have access to affordable housing, food, and healthcare support. Vassie Fowler, the Executive Director of Seeds of Hope then told us about the collaboration that is required to connect York County people in need with the appropriate community leaders. Vassie spread a little more holiday cheer this season by sharing that she serves as the honorable Mrs. Claus in York County. Next, I had a conversation with David Patch who is helping to reduce the stress of our service members who are transitioning from active duty to veteran status. He serves as the commander of American Legion Post 36 , and works with the Mid-Coast Veterans Council , Honor Flight Maine , and Veterans No Boundaries . Thank you for your service to our troops, David. My last discussion was with Sarah Duncan, the Executive Director of United Way Aroostook who is working daily to connect Aroostook organizations with residents in need. Their work is critical to Maine people and I am eternally grateful for their service to our state. During this holiday season, I hope everyone will continue to build on this work by finding a volunteering opportunity near them. Each of us can do something to make someone's day a little brighter. I'm deeply thankful for everything that my guests do for our communities and I'm deeply thankful for you - my Maine neighbors that make this state a fabulous place to live.

We'll fight tooth and nail to get America back on the right track - regardless of the resistance we will face from the Chuck Schumer-led Senate and Biden-controlled White House. READING HERE In Case you missed it Washington Democrats ended this Congress just as they began it, with President Biden and his allies ramming through a reckless $2 trillion spending bill. Over the last two years, the American people have seen their lives upended by one crisis after another - at the border, at the supermarket, and at the gas pump. On Tuesday, we'll mark the end of one-party Washington Democrat rule and the start of a new Republican majority. We're ready to hit the ground running on day one to fulfill our commitment to America by improving the lives of working-class families. CLICK HERE to read my 117 th Congress recap of Washington Democrats' reckless spending spree and the impact it's had on American families. The economic crush of rampant Washington spending has put the squeeze to American families over the last two years. The American people voted for a new Republican majority to put a stop to the reckless spending and get our fiscal house in order. They expect us to use every tool at our disposal to force changes to spending, get our border under control, and reignite American energy production. CLICK HERE to read my recent opinion piece detailing exactly how bad things have gotten under complete Democrat control in Washington and where Republicans can start to address the various crises born under one-party Democrat rule in Washington. House Democrats ended 2022 and their majority in the House by releasing President Trump's private tax returns for no reason other than pure political spite. In the waning days of their majority, Democrats have chosen to focus their time and attention on attacking a political rival instead of confronting the real problems facing the American people. Washington Democrats will only have themselves to blame for this new precedent at the Ways & Means Committee as Republicans take control this week and begin true Oversight of the Biden White House. CLICK HERE to read my statement slamming Washington Democrats for releasing President Trump's private taxpayer information.

17," January 1, 2023 Wishing You a Happy New Year A MESSAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN HOYER I join in wishing a joyful New Year full of prosperity and opportunity to families across the Fifth District today. I am grateful for another opportunity to serve my constituents in this new year, and appreciate the work House Democrats have done under our Democratic Majority to deliver for Americans across the county. This morning, I had the chance to join Dana Bash on CNN's ""State of the Union"" to discuss my career and tenure in elected leadership. During the interview , we talked about my time in the Maryland State Senate, legislative achievements including the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Affordable Care Act, as well as my decision not to seek elected leadership in the next Congress. As we look ahead to the New Year, I am confident Democrats will continue our work to advocate for the most pressing needs of the American people. From working to protect health care coverage, to strengthening voting rights, to ensuring the economy works for everyone, Democrats will continue our work For The People.

20," Friends, Happy New Year! I am incredibly honored to have spent the past year representing you and Ohio's 14th Congressional District in the halls of Congress. As 2022 comes to an end, I wanted to provide an update on all that we have accomplished together these past 12 months. Over the course of 2022, I introduced 19 pieces of legislation and had seven bills signed into law by the President: H.R. 8785 , Lake Erie Water Quality Protection Act H.R. 8965 , Aquatic Invasive Species Control Act H.R. 6735 , Supporting Access to Nurse Exams (SANE) Act H.R. 654 , Drug Free Communities Pandemic Relief Act H.R. 3050 , Kenneth Meisel Public Servants' Claimant Fairness Act H.R. 7746 , Sgt. Wolf Kyle Weninger Veterans Education Fairness Act of 2022 H.R. 5274 , Prevent Exposure to Narcotics and Toxins (PREVENT) Act I am proud to be known as someone who has fought to end Washington's gridlock. In fact, I was rated the 31st most bipartisan member of Congress. That's because I made sure every bill I introduced and supported would help our community first and foremost. I take seriously the responsibility to not only scrutinize federal spending but also to direct it where it's needed most back home. I am proud that I was able to secure nearly $18 million tax dollars to be returned to local projects, such as dredging Fairport and Conneaut Harbors, building an updated Lake County Emergency Operations Center, and providing expansions to and improvements for the Willoughby-Eastlake Water Pollution Control Center, the McFarland Waste Water Treatment Plant, and the Village of Chagrin Falls wastewater treatment plant. Alongside returning your tax dollars back to northeast Ohio, my top legislative priorities were to get our economy back on track, reestablish America's energy independence, restore law and order, protect the Great Lakes, and help our communities fight the fentanyl crisis. Getting Our Economy Back on Track I was proud to co-lead the introduction of the TCJA Permanency Act to make permanent 23 different tax cuts for individuals, families and small businesses. I also introduced the Small Business Cybersecurity Assistance Pilot Program Act to provide small businesses with access to critical cybersecurity tools amid heightened cyber threats and the Commission on the American Workforce Act to help overcome the labor shortage hurting businesses in our communities. Reestablishing America's Energy Independence I cosponsored the American Energy Independence from Russia Act to require the Biden Administration to unleash America's domestic energy, reduce our dependence on foreign fuel sources, and stimulate economic growth in energy-abundant states like Ohio. I also introduced an amendment to force the Biden Administration to flip the switch on their failed energy policies and lower energy costs for Americans by issuing offshore oil and gas lease sales. Restoring Law and Order I was proud to introduce the Advanced Border Coordination Act to establish Joint Operation Centers along the southern border to bolster security efforts and improve law enforcement coordination. I also cosponsored the POLICE Act to make assaulting a police officer a deportable offense and introduced the Fighting Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Act to help establish mental health programs for America's law enforcement and first responders. Protecting the Great Lakes I joined a group of bipartisan colleagues in introducing the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Reauthorization Act to conserve, restore, and manage Lake Erie's fish and wildlife populations and their habitats, which was signed into law this month. I also introduced the DEFEND the Great Lakes Act to support shoreline communities along Lake Erie by adjusting a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers program and ensuring targeted federal funding can be directed to resilience projects in our most vulnerable shoreline areas. Fighting the Fentanyl Crisis I introduced the Stop Pills That Kill Act to increase criminal penalties for those producing lethal counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl. I also introduced and got signed into law the Drug Free Communities Pandemic Relief Act, mentioned earlier, to empower local communities in their fight against addiction. I also cosponsored six bills, including the Border Security for America Act, that would address the border crisis by resuming border wall construction, deploying effective drug detection technology, and placing more boots on the ground. My staff and I were also able to respond to over 54,000 constituent inquiries and help 1,869 constituents with a federal agency throughout the course of 2022. If you need assistance with a federal agency, such as the Social Security Administration, Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Internal Revenue Service or any other federal government department, my office is here to help you. While I cannot override the decisions made by a federal agency, my staff and I can often intervene on a person's behalf to answer questions, find solutions, or just cut through the red tape. Heading into 2023, please know my staff is available to assist if you are having issues with federal agencies like the Social Security Administration, the VA, IRS, USPS, or Passport Agencies. They can also take down your concerns on federal issues or help you with other services offered by my office, such as U.S. flag requests or Washington, DC tours. While I am proud of the great deal we accomplished this year, rest assured I know there is still much work to be done. As we head into 2023, I promise to keep fighting to ensure Washington is working hard for Ohio, not the other way around. Since you have given me the opportunity to represent you, I pledged that each and every day I would get up and represent northeast Ohio to the best of my ability in Congress. Every morning as I start my day I remember that promise and as we head into 2023, I will continue to uphold my pledge to you. As always, it is an honor to serve you in the U.S. House of Representatives.

It's Been a Heck of a Year! Closing Time… This is my last newsletter of 2022 and, my last newsletter as Congressman for the 4th Congressional District. Starting January 3, 2023, I will be representing District 9, which includes large chunks of CD4 but adds in areas in the West Valley of Phoenix (Glendale, Peoria, Goodyear, Litchfield Park, Pebble Creek, etc). As the song goes, ""every new beginning is some other beginning's end."" I share below some highlights, and a couple lowlights, from the year. But most of all, I want to share how honored I am to represent you, to fight for you in Congress, to represent you and your real American values, and to fight against the decay and rot that is infecting our country. As always, I choose peace over war. Love over hate. And Christ above all else. I am a positive guy, so most of this newsletter focuses on good things. But we live in strange times, so I would be remiss if I didn't spell out some lowlights for the year: The Lowlights 1. The Biden regime has hired men who like to pretend they are women, and predictably these men have done an awful job. Who would have thought that a mentally ill man would fail at basic job assignments: Sam Britton-fired to stealing women's clothing. And should have been fired for being incompetent. Bob ""Rachel"" Levine-also fond of wearing women's clothing, and also a failure at public health. The pandemic got worse as soon as he was put in charge. 2. The vaccine: it is now more apparent than ever that the vaccine was neither safe nor effective. Heart disease and death, inflicted by the experimental drug, has caused untold death and suffering globally. Studies have now confirmed the supposed cure is far worse than simply getting COVID-19. 3. Censorship: although suspected for years, there is now hard proof that the federal government, and some state governments (including Katie Hobbs in Arizona) actively colluded with social media platforms including Twitter, Google, Facebook and Instagram, to censor political opponents and dissident views. This censorship is unconstitutional and illegal. 4. Ukraine: the Bidens, long since on Ukraine's payroll through bribery (remember Burisma?), continue to pay back their debt to Ukraine by spending our money on a proxy war. Our taxpayer dollars are being wasted in Ukraine on a war we have no business in, and supporting a corrupt regime that has banned opposition parties, banned Christianity, banned free media and engages in war crimes on a regular basis. On top of that, our borders remain open as we send billions to defend Ukraine borders. 5. Our border remains open with record levels of illegal aliens invading our country. By the time you are reading this nearly five and half million illegal aliens will have crossed into the U.S. illegally in just two years. Crime is rampant. Drug deaths and homelessness continue to grow and fester. Drug and sex traffickers flourish, real wages continue to drop, and housing prices increase. This is all due to illegal aliens and an open border. 6. The Omnibus: the spending bill passed by democrats is a great example of waste and demonstrates a clear hatred for America and American taxpayers. The policies being funded in this bill put America Last and other countries first. The policies further leftist cultural attacks on the historic culture of our nation. Here's a look back on the key legislation I introduced or cosponsored and a summary of other important issues impacting Arizona's fourth congressional district and all of America. In response to Mr. Biden issuing his unlawful Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rule requiring private businesses with 100 or more employees to enforce vaccine mandates, I quickly went to work and introduced a joint resolution to terminate the unconstitutional vaccine rule. Did you know that foreign investors account for almost one-third of investment in single-family rental homes in the United States? It's true! Worse, the Chinese Communist Party is attempting to buy up land in the United States, with an emphasis on farmland to gain strategic leverage over the United States. This is a direct threat to American way of life and our economic security. In response, I cosponsored H.R. 6383, the National Security Moratorium on Foreign Purchases of U.S. Land Act to prohibit foreigners from purchasing public or private land in the United States for five years. This year, I cosponsored three very important pieces of legislation designed to improve border security along the southern border. H.R. 1707, the Border Visibility and Security Act directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to install surveillance technology, including radar systems, tunnel detection technology and usage of unmanned aerial vehicles to establish situational awareness and operational control of the border. I also cosponsored H.R. 4593, the Securing our Border States Act . This important legislation would establish a block grant program that would allow border states to continue constructing a barrier along their borders with Mexico. This bill would give direct access to funding to Governors of southwest border states who certify that they will use the funding for wall construction. I also cosponsored H.R. 2003, the Secure the Southern Border Act , legislation that would enact into law President Trump's border policies that had a proven record of vastly slowing illegal border crossings. This includes ending ""catch and release,"" reinstating the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, partnering with state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws and ending sanctuary cities and allowing the National Guard to help defend our homeland by bolstering Border Patrol's manpower. I teamed up with Russell Walkner from Bullhead City to introduce H.R. 6675, the Independent VA Audit Act, legislation to improve the healthcare system of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Arizona is home to tens of thousands of veterans. On any given day, veterans in my district contact me to share horror stories regarding long delays to receive an appointment for hospital care and medical services. So, when Russell came to me with his suggestion for an independent audit of the VA, I immediately went to work and turned his common-sense idea into legislation. I don't often sign pledges as my pledge is to the Constitution of the United States and the flag. However, this year, the American Principle's Project launched the Big Families Pledge for supporting pro-family policies that I felt merited my support. The family and the basics of responsibility and morality of family life are under assault from the Left's constant attack on the unborn, nuclear family, and more. This pledge is a commitment to defend girls' sports by prohibiting biological males from participating, protecting children from experimental gender transition procedures, protecting kids from the harmful teachings of Critical Racing Theory, safeguarding children from pornography, and protecting life from conception to natural death. I already sponsor and cosponsor legislation to achieve these goals, so I was proud to join this pledge. In 2022, across America mask mandates were finally lifted , schools, churches and businesses reopened and life returned to normal. Yet, Mr. Biden extended the COVID-19 national emergency for another year despite painting an optimistic portrait of life for Americans after COVID-19 during his State of the Union address. The extraordinary powers given to Mr. Biden to deal with the pandemic are no longer justified. Under the current COVID-19 national emergency declaration, more than 120 emergency statutory powers can be invoked by Mr. Biden, including the power to draft Americans without consent, raising Dr. Fauci's salary, further barricading the United States Capitol, and placing the Public Health Service under military control. In response, I introduced House Joint Resolution 46 and twice moved to terminate the national emergency. Sadly, both times Nancy Pelosi changed the rules of the entire House to prevent this from happening. I was very pleased that Senate passed a companion to my resolution that would terminate the COVID-19 national emergency declaration and emergency presidential powers and I am optimistic that the new Republican majority in the House will finally take up my legislation. Click here to learn more about the National Emergency Act and my full statement. While I have deep compassion and sympathy for the horrible suffering of the people of Ukraine and am moved by their nationalis m, I voted against a resolution to drag the United States into another war. The resolution demanded that an armed attack against one or more NATO member in Europe or North America is considered an attack against them all and consequently America would be obligated to go to war. This is an unconstitutional infringement on Article 1 Section 8 Clause 11 of the United States Constitution, which grants only Congress the power to declare war, not NATO allies. I have repeatedly stated that this conflict has nothing to do with American national security and not one American soldier should be dragged into a war 5,000 miles away when there is no reason to be there. In fact, I voted against every single bill to fund the war in Ukraine and I will not support any request to continue the needless death and destruction on both sides in this war. Our nation is under attack at the southern border, inflation is at an historic high and our country is buried in $31 trillion national debt. It is wrong for Congress to continue sending pallets of taxpayer dollars to perpetuate a needless war. This year, I introduced the No Gun Lists Act, legislation endorsed by Gun Owners of America, that would require the ATF to immediately eliminate their illegal firearm record repository system, prohibit the relisting of records, and allow gun owners to sue the ATF for damages and injunctive relief. In its latest attempt to keep track of all law-abiding gun-owners and implement its unconstitutional gun control agenda, the Biden administration has ordered the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) create a gun owner database of almost a billion searchable records, prohibited by current federal law. In just the past year, the ATF has stockpiled the records of over 54 million legal gun owners according to troubling document first reported by the Washington Free Beacon. Click here to learn more about this legislation and read my entire statement. This past March, I hosted a round table in Goodyear, Arizona to discuss the deadly effects of fentanyl throughout the country, including right here in Arizona. I am incredibly grateful to the dozens of community leaders, law enforcement officials and families who lost loved ones from fentanyl who joined me for this important discussion. Our open borders have allowed drug and sex traffickers free reign to inflict terror in our country. Fentanyl is destroying our communities and families. It is killing our children and loved ones. More than 105,000 people died last year from fentanyl. Fentanyl is now the leading cause of death in America among 18- to 45-year-olds. Disturbingly, most of the fentanyl in our communities finds its way there via our open southern border. Law enforcement officials along the border continue to seize record amounts of fentanyl, yet much still gets through as officials struggle to keep up with the drug smugglers along the U.S. - Mexico border. Stopping the flow of fentanyl begins with sealing off our border to protect our communities from this deadly drug. In that regard, I voted to permanently place fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. This would make fentanyl in all combinations subject to the harshest criminal penalties currently available. My vote to permanently deem fentanyl-related substances among the most controlled Schedule 1 drugs would have given law enforcement officials the tools they need to combat this threat and take swift action against drug traffickers. Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress refuse to take this crisis seriously and this important vote failed. I also introduced the Cartel Haven Sanction Act, legislation to impose economic sanctions on Mexico for its failure to stop illicit and deadly drugs, including fentanyl, from crossing the border. The Cartel Haven Sanctions Act will liquidate cartel assets and prohibit remittances from the U.S. to Mexico until the date on which a physical wall on the international border between the U.S. and Mexico has been constructed and is fully operational. And I introduced H.R. 8228, the Death Penalty for Dealing Fentanyl Act, legislation that would punish a defendant with the death penalty or life in prison if convicted of selling or distributing fentanyl. This past Spring, I joined the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on an inspection trip to our under-siege southern border, from California to Yuma. We journeyed from San Diego, California, to Yuma, Arizona, to examine how President Biden has opened our borders and allowed over five million illegal aliens to prance into our country. I introduced the Resort Fee Transparency Act. This common sense legislation brings fairness and transparency by addressing what are called ""resort fees"" or ""destination fees"" or ""mandatory parking fees"" or in some cases ""electricity fees."" Whatever the fees are c alled, if they are not disclosed to you before you make your reservation and you learn about them when you check out, that is unfair and my bill seeks to force hotels to let you know when you make your reservation what mandatory fees they will force you to pay. I also cosponsored .72 , a Congressional Review Act resolution disapproving of the Center for Disease Control's mask mandates on planes, buses and trains. T he masks most people wear, including surgical masks, do nothing to stop viruses. That being said, wear a mask if you want to. It's your choice. But the federal government should not be mandating their usage. To assist veterans, I cosponsored the Emergency Community Care Notification Time Adjustment Act , important legislation that would change the requirement to notify the Veterans Affairs (VA) of emergency treatment provided by a community care partner or health care facility outside of the VA from 72 hours after admittance to 72 hours after discharge. This bill would provide veterans more time to notify the VA, allowing them and their families to focus on their health and recovery. This Summer, the Biden administration announced the creation of the Disinformation Governance Board to spy on American citizens and double down on this administration's continued abuse of powers to attack Americans who disagree with its policies, smearing them as extremists. In response, I sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas opposing the establishment of the Disinformation Governance Board. You can read the full text of my letter here. Earlier this year, I voted to extend the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) two additional years to provide benefit payments to persons who developed cancer or other related illnesses after being exposed to radiation from atomic weapons testing during our nation's Cold War Era. A two-year extension is certainly helpful, but congress has a moral responsibility to update RECA and should stop dragging its feet and immediately take up H.R 538, the Downwinders Parity Act of 2021 , important bipartisan legislation I authored that would extend RECA coverage to all of Mohave and Clark Counties. The World Health Organization (WHO) is a corrupt and feckless international institution completely beholden to China and cares nothing about the United States. President Trump was 100% right to withdraw the U.S. from this organization. To prevent Biden from further ceding American sovereignty to unelected global foreigners at the WHO, I cosponsored the Protecting American Sovereignty Act, legislation that would prevent Biden from surrendering American sovereignty to the WHO through the proposed Global Pandemic Treaty by prohibiting the use of taxpayer dollars from carrying out the treaty, therefore blocking it from taking effect. In a related matter, I also cosponsored the WHO Withdrawal Act. This legislation requires the President to withdraw the United States from the WHO, repeals the law that originally authorized the United States to join the WHO, and prevents taxpayer money from being spent to participate in the WHO. I voted against every unconstitutional gun control bills, including red flag laws, that will absolutely do nothing to stop gun violence, but will most certainly give the federal government more power to implement Biden's gun grab agenda and punish law-abiding gun owners. I want to also let you know that I introduced a bill that would eliminate all income taxes on social security benefits. I introduced the ""No Taxation on Social Security Act of 2021"" to stop our government from unjustly taxing these benefits, benefits you have already been taxed for over the years. It makes no sense for the federal government to punish senior citizens who saved for retirement or who continue to work. All this does is increase the scope of the federal government and deprive Americans of what they are rightfully entitled to. You can read more about my bill here . In June, the United States Supreme Court overturned the egregiously immoral and unconstitutional Roe v. Wade, correcting an injustice that has led to over 62 million American babies slaughtered in the past 50 years! The court rightfully said that abortion is not a federal right and is not part of the federal constitution. It is a state issue. The court's decision is a return to civilization, equality and the respect for all human life. As amazing and historic the Supreme Court's decision regarding Roe v. Wade was, across the country leftist domestic terrorists and extremists rioted in the streets to protest the decision for days throughout the summer. Highways were being illegally blocked, people were being pulled from their vehicles and assaulted, bricks were thrown at automobiles, property was destroyed and police officers were attacked. In response to these hostile and illegal actions, I cosponsored the Protecting Mothers and Babies from Terrorism Act, legislation that deems the actions of these groups and other pro-abortion radical groups as domestic terrorists. Supreme Court justice and other government officials should not be subjected to angry protests and violent threats at home because of leaked news reports pertaining the Roe v. Wade. In response, I cosponsored H.R. 7799, the Public Servant Protection Act, legislation to protect all government employees and their families from having their home addresses listed publicly online. Earlier this summer, the Town of Payson declared June 28 as Paul Gosar Day and Mayor Morrissey presented me with the honorary keys to the town! I have had the privilege and honor of representing Payson for more than a decade in the United States House of Representatives. Payson is a wonderful town and its people will always be close to my heart. I cosponsored, H.R. 1417, the Safety and Opportunity for Girl Act of 2021 . This legislation would clarify that nothing in Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 can be interpreted to give the Biden administration the authority to prohibit schools from maintaining sex-segregated bathrooms, locker, rooms, sports teams, and academic programs. The bill also adds a clear definition of sex to Title IX to clarify that ""sex"" means biological sex, not gender identity. Free speech is a bedrock of the United States, but the overwhelmingly left-leaning Big Tech companies have taken that right away from Americans by policing speech they disagree with. Tech platforms have become the de-facto town square, where free speech is and always should be protected. Big Tech, including Facebook and Twitter, have been caught colluding with the Biden Regime to censor free speech. This is an illegal deprivation of civil rights. The government cannot censor lawful speech even if done indirectly. In response, I introduced the Stop Censorship Act to revoke Big Tech's broad immunity for the removal of ""otherwise objectionable"" material and instead protects the removal of ""unlawful material,"" extends protections to platforms for empowering users with the option to restrict access to any material, ensures Section 230 does not provide immunity from antitrust claims and requires platforms to abide by their own terms of service. This past Autumn, I sponsored legislation prohibiting Joe Biden from releasing illegals into America. The Ending Catch and Release Act of 2022 amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to prohibit the Biden Administration from continuing to release illegal aliens into the country. Th e Biden administration has ended the successful policies of the Trump administration that secured our border by reinstating Obama's failed catch and release policies that ignore current laws. As a result, more than five million lawbreakers have crossed our southern border since Biden became President. I also introduced the Empowering States to Deport Illegal Aliens Act, legislation that will allows states to authorize state and local law enforcement officers to enforce federal immigration laws and prosecute anyone who illegally enters the country that is residing in their state. Our border is a war zone and fentanyl is ravaging communities all across America. It is going to take the states to fight this invasion, while Joe Biden does absolutely nothing to keep us safe. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many states and localities violated the rights of American citizens to assemble by refusing them entry into churches, places of business, and entertainment venues and they restricted the rights of American citizens by denying them the ability to earn a living and provide for a family through forced inoculation of the COVID-19 vaccine. We must never again allow the total violation of our rights that occurred during the COVID-19 lockdowns and mandates. In response, I introduced the End Lockdowns and Vaccine Mandates Act, legislation that prevents states and the federal government from forbidding people from entering a place of business or having to receive an inoculation as a condition of employment. Religion and its moral basis are fundamental to the success of our republic, which was recognized by our Founding Fathers, including John Adams who stated that ""our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people."" Unfortunately, hostility towards Christians and individuals of faith in the United States is prevalent in modern American culture and governmental institutions. The growing hostility is a problem Congress needs to address. In response, this year I cosponsored H. Res. 1416, legislation condemning the growing hostility towards Christians and individuals of faith in the United States while opposing the advancement of sexual orientation and gender identity laws, regulations, and policies that suppress Americans' ability to freely exercise their religion. We can all agree that the world has seen enough death and destruction among Russia and Ukraine this year. In response, I felt compelled to send an invitation to Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Arizona to begin conversations to deescalate nuclear tensions, terminate the war and end the unfortunate death and destruction plaguing both countries. The current posture is untenable and a pathway to peace is long overdue. Months of escalation in weaponry and rhetoric endangers not just the citizens of Russia and Ukraine, but the whole world. Joe Biden and Congress have wasted over $100 billion American taxpayer dollars funding a proxy war. Ever ask yourself where did all that money go? I joined a group of House Republicans and introduced H. Res. 1482 , a resolution to audit the funds appropriated by Congress to Ukraine. This important resolution demands that Joe Biden, along with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, provide the House of Representatives copies of all documents and any financial statements detailing purchases, recipients, and government expenditures related to congressionally appropriated funds given to Ukraine. I voted against every single bill to fund the war in Ukraine and I will not support any effort continue the needless death and destruction on both sides in this war. We should not send another dime to Ukraine and we should audit the money already sent there. This year, I introduced the Clean Disaster Relief Resolution, legislation that stipulates any bill that appropriates funding for emergency assistance in response to major disasters, including wildfires, be a standalone bill and not combined with any other legislative measure. Anyone who reads the Gosar Newsletter or has heard me speak knows that I often comment that good process makes for good policy and good politics. The ugly truth is that congress repeatedly loads up well-intended disaster relief funding legislation with flawed and costly provisions making it difficult for members of congress, including me, to support final passage. This resolution will allow members of congress to cast a clean vote on providing meaningful federal disaster relief without the inclusion of other ridiculous and unrelated legislative provisions. That's what I call good policy! As a Christian, I believe marriage to be a God-ordained covenant relationship between one man and one woman, as does the Constitution for the state of Arizona. I voted against harmful legislation to dismantle the traditional marriage covenant. This was nothing more than the latest attack on all God-loving individuals who embrace the biblical teaching on marriage. As the waning days of congress wrap up, the 2022 voting scorecards came out and I am proud to say that I continue to fight for America First and conservative values. From protecting your Second Amendment to blocking the constant stampede of illegal aliens to defending the traditional family, there were many causes to champion for the residents of the 4 th congressional district. The contentment of advocacy organizations has been reflected in their vote scorecards evaluating me. American Family Action Network, the American Conservative Union Foundation, Gun Owners of America , NumbersUSA, F reedomWorks , Turning Point Action and Heritage Action all gave me the highest score possible. I encourage you to click on these important scorecards and see how I voted on key issues and compare it to others in our state and around the country. In the closing days of 2022, the U.S. House of Representatives passed two Republican bills that I have worked tirelessly for several years to get enacted. S. 3308, the Colorado River Indian Tribes (CRIT) Water Resiliency Act and S. 4104, the Hualapai Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act both passed with resounding bi-partisan support. Both bills will finally give these Tribes control over their water and allow them to assist other communities in Arizona suffering from water supply challenges. As Congress wrapped up its legislative session, my final vote was against the disastrous $1.7 trillion, 4155-page omnibus spending bill to fund the federal government for the remainder of the fiscal year 2023, I voted against this colossal mess for many reasons. In particular, the omnibus sends $45 billion to protect Ukraine's border. I also sends $410 million to protect the borders of Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia and Oman but it spends zero dollars to protect our own borders. This last minute, lame duck legislation was a betrayal of American voters' wishes as expressed at the ballot box in November.

Finally, let me close be saying that I am honored to have earned another term representing Arizona in the United States House of Representatives. Last year, the Independent Redistricting Commission completed its monumental task of creating new legislative and congressional districts, something that occurs every 10 years following the decennial census. Beginning next January, my new Congressional district will be district nine, which includes areas in Mohave County, La Paz County, Yuma County and Maricopa County that I have already represented for the last decade. There will be some new towns and faces added in and I am looking forward to meeting my new constituents. I have to express my sadness, however, in not having Yavapai County, Pinal County and Gila County in my new district. Over the last ten years I have made so many friends, and I have had the pleasure of traveling from Florence to Chino Valley, Jerome to Apache Junction, and all points in-between. I will continue to visit and stop by as often as I can, and I will always be available to help with issues, talk, and work for all Arizonans. Thank you so much for your unwavering support! It's been the honor of my lifetime representing you in congress. That's a wrap! I look forward to 2023. Happy New Year!

26," Rep. Grothman Newsletter- 2022, A Year in Review Looking Back on 2022 2022 was a memorable year for Americans from all walks of life. Despite the many challenges facing our nation, the families, small businesses, employees, and students I've met this past year give me optimism for 2023. I look forward to continuing to make your voice heard in Washington in the 118th is a look back at some highlights from 2022. Looking Back on 2022 2022 was a memorable year for Americans from all walks of life. Despite the many challenges facing our nation, the families, small businesses, employees, and students I've met this past year give me optimism for 2023. I look forward to continuing to make your voice heard in Washington in the 118th Congress. Here is a look back at some highlights from 2022. January Every January, it's great to meet so many people that travel to Washington from all areas of the country to support the sanctity of life at the March for Life . I will continue to defend the rights of the unborn in the new year! Fentanyl is tearing families apart in what has become the deadliest drug overdose crisis in American history. This deadly drug is largely smuggled into the United States by Mexican drug cartels, and it is now the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45. On January 18 , I joined ""Wake Up America"" to discuss the border crisis, and my legislation to bring a sorely-needed increase to the penalty of trafficking deadly fentanyl. Click the above image for more information Through Medicare Advantage , tens of millions of older adults, including many with disabilities, have access to comprehensive, affordable health coverage choices. I am working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to preserve and strengthen this program for elderly Americans who rely on it. On January 26 , I was proud to sign this bipartisan letter urging the Department of Health and Human Services to maintain a patient-centered approach to Medicare Advantage coverage. Click the above image for more information February On February 16 , the House Budget Committee held a hearing titled, ""Why Congress Needs to Abolish the Debt Limit."" My Committee colleagues on the other side of the aisle spent their time arguing that the debt limit should be eliminated due to the threat of a default and the potential consequences for the federal budget and economy. While I do not believe the U.S. should default, the practical way to avoid this is to rein in spending, not eliminate the debt limit and open the door to $trillions more being added to the debt, which is now over $31 trillion for the first time in history. During the hearing, I asked the former Director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, about the root cause of the inflation ""tax"" and the need to balance our federal budget. We need to create a responsible budget, which is why I am always looking for ways to hold Washington accountable and secure a brighter future for our children and grandchildren. In the third week of February , I celebrated National Future Farmers of America (FFA) Week by meeting with the Wisconsin FFA and acknowledging the crucial role this organization plays in teaching the next generation of Wisconsinites how to be leaders in the food and agriculture industry. On February 18 , I met with Tom Kulczewski from Real Sportscards, Mark Homan from Homan Auto, Alderman Rohn Bishop (who is now the Mayor of Waupun), and Sam Kaufman in Waupun. I always appreciate meeting up with community leaders to discuss the needs of the people of the Sixth District. March On March 3 , I introduced the Senior Independence Act . This bill will remove government red tape that prevents senior citizens from returning to work. With over 10 million job openings currently in the U.S., and a lack of skilled workers, many seniors who are willing to work are opting not to because of restrictive government regulations. Click the image above to read the full bill text On March 22 , I hosted a telephone town hall meeting for all residents of the Sixth District! I was happy to take your questions and provide an update on my work in Congress. On March 29 , it was a pleasure meeting with the National Association of Postal Supervisors to build on our efforts to improve the efficiency within the USPS. April In April, I went to the Southern border for a firsthand look at the crisis. We made stops at the San Diego Sector in California, El Centro Sector in California, and Yuma Sector in Arizona. Every border patrol agent, ICE agent and local law enforcement officer I spoke with made it clear - migrants from all around the world are exploiting the same loopholes in our immigration system to be let into the interior of the United States within days because these loopholes are not a secret, they are advertised. Border Patrol informed me that the Yuma sector alone has encountered migrants from over 140 different countries. Watch my report from the San Diego Sector of the Southern border below. On April 19 , I had the opportunity to meet the talented students of Cedarburg High School's Coding Club and congratulate them on winning the 2021 Congressional App Challenge! It was an honor to be recognized by the Association for Mature American Citizens on April 27 for protecting the rights of seniors and families in Congress. Thank you for presenting me with the American PATRIOT Award! May On May 3 , I congratulated Grace Zhang of Sheboygan North High School for earning first place in the Sixth District's 2022 Congressional Art Competition. Grace's beautiful artwork, titled ""A Glimpse,"" is now on display in the U.S. Capitol for visitors, staff, and Members of Congress to see! A Glimpse In the second week of May, we came together to celebrate National Police Week by sharing gratitude to law enforcement for dedicating their lives to protecting our communities. On the morning of May 12 , I showed my respect and appreciation for our nation's officers at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Broad student loan forgiveness would mostly benefit the wealthy while disproportionately hurting low-income Americans by feeding inflation. On May 13 , I headed a letter with 22 of my colleagues warning President Biden of the dire consequences of such a backward policy, one he lacks authority to issue. Click the image above to read the full letter June In Wisconsin, we are incredibly lucky to call the Hmong our neighbors. During the Vietnam War, the Hmong people fought alongside American troops and risked their lives in the name of the principles and freedoms promoted by the United States. On June 16 , I introduced legislation , with 38 bipartisan cosponsors, including the entire Wisconsin delegation, to honor the Hmong people with the Congressional Gold Medal for their help in the Vietnam War. I am glad that both sides of the aisle came together to recognize the service of Hmong individuals who bravely served our country in the fight against communism on the world stage. The 2022 Hmong National Memorial Day in Oshkosh On June 11 , I joined the Beechwood Fire Department at their 107th Annual Picnic. Thank you all for volunteering to protect our communities! On June 24 , the Supreme Court made the correct and much-needed decision to overturn Roe v. Wade . Over the years, millions of children have had their dreams stolen before seeing the light of the day. It is important for America to remember, when ultrasounds were practically unheard of, 47 states had made abortion illegal. Now, with accurate ultrasounds, it is clear to all Americans that unborn children are human beings. July As an advocate for individuals with disabilities, I was thrilled to meet with the folks from the Disability Service Providers Network in early July and hear about their efforts to support communities and families across Wisconsin. In the third week of July , I spoke on the House floor to warn my colleagues that spending increases will fuel the inflation crisis , not end it. For every dollar printed by the Federal Reserve, the dollars already in circulation lose value. On July 28 , it was an honor to be presented with the Hero of Main Street Award by the National Retail Federation in recognition of my commitment to supporting retail jobs in Congress. The retail industry provides work to thousands of employees across the Sixth District! August During a typical month, the House is in session three weeks and in recess one week. Some representatives stay in Washington when we are in session for weeks at a time, but I always come back to Wisconsin on the weekends. Every August, Congress is out-of-session for the whole month, so each member has the chance to go back to their district to stay in touch with the people who elected them and hear which issues are most important to each local community. This August, I held four town hall meetings during the district-work period. Thank you to everyone who attended! On August 12 , Congress was called back to Washington for one day to vote on the deceptively-named ""Inflation Reduction"" Act. The price tag of this bill, which you as a taxpayer are responsible for, is $745 billion . Of the many reckless provisions in this bill, one of the most unsettling is the plan to supercharge the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with an army of 87,000 new agents. Handing the IRS nearly six times its annual budget - $80 billion - to double the agency in size will enable them to target middle-income families and exacerbate the many problems facing our nation. That's one of the many reasons I voted against this bill. On the House floor, I spoke in opposition of this reckless, partisan tax-and-spend bill. Student loan debt cannot be erased. Someone always must pay. With broad student loan ""cancellation"", the burden would be transferred to the American taxpayers, the majority of which never took out loans or have paid them back in full. Despite this reality, on August 24 , President Biden bypassed Congress and followed through with his plan to ""cancel"" federal student loan debt. In anticipation of the President's decision regarding student loans, I introduced the Fairness for Responsible Borrowers Act to protect Americans from this shortsighted policy by clarifying that the President doesn't have the authority to cancel student loan debt without Congressional approval. September In September , the world came together to mourn the passing of Queen Elizabeth II . The reign of Queen Elizabeth II symbolized the best of British tradition. For more than 70 years, she fearlessly defended human rights across the globe and met with many world leaders, including 13 U.S. Presidents. I hope that her successors will continue to reinforce her commitment to advancing individual liberties and representing the Church of England on the world stage. While the legacy of Queen Elizabeth II lives on, may she rest in peace. On September 14 , I was proud to receive an A rating from Moms for America in recognition of my record of defending mothers and families in Congress. During a House Oversight Committee hearing on September 15 , Michael Shellenberger and I discussed America's lead in advancing environmental preservation. The United States has led the world in reducing carbon emissions while other large economies continue to pollute the environment. On September 17 , I spoke at the Alzheimer's Association's Walk to End Alzheimer's in Manitowoc in support of the fight to raise awareness and end this devastating disease. October The beginning of October marked the conclusion of Fiscal Year 2022. For the first time in our nation's history, the Department of Homeland Security reported that Border Patrol apprehended over 2 million illegal immigrants at the Southwest border in Fiscal Year 2022 alone, on top of an estimated 600,000 ""got-aways"" who dodged Border Patrol altogether. Time after time, Border Patrol agents have emphasized their frustration to me with Secretary Mayorkas and President Biden who refuse to even attempt to put an end to this devastating, unprecedented humanitarian crisis. The Biden Administration's neglect has served as a gateway to heinous abuses against women and children at the hands of criminal drug cartels, who are generating billions in profits. Click the image above for more information On October 10 , I wished all my Taiwanese friends worldwide a prosperous and happy Taiwan National Day . Taiwan is an important American ally in the Asia-Pacific region, and I am glad to use my role as a Congressman to strengthen the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. On October 26 , I had a wonderful visit to Hennings Cheese in Kiel, which is a perfect example of a family-owned small business that has contributed to Wisconsin becoming America's premier cheese producer since its founding in 1914. November In November , I was humbled to be elected to serve as a regional representative to the Republican Policy Committee (RPC), which plays an essential role in the legislative proposals and policy focuses of the House Republican Conference. By serving on the RPC, I will have the opportunity to bring our Wisconsin values and commonsense solutions to the Congressional leadership table to tackle the many issues facing our nation today and help our communities thrive. On Veterans Day , Americans come together in unity to recognize the tremendous service and sacrifice America's vets made to our country. The United States is blessed to have the world's best servicemen and women defending our freedoms, and Veterans Day is a reminder of the respect and gratitude we owe them for their service. On November 10 , I was honored to spend time with veterans from the Sixth District over lunch in Oshkosh to discuss the need for greater accountability and efficiency within our government to support veterans. On November 22 , I had the opportunity to see all the amazing work Plexus Corp. is doing in Neenah to provide manufacturing expertise and complex product solutions on a global scale. Companies like this are essential in strengthening our supply chain and Wisconsin's economy. December On December 6 , I joined my friend Congressman Doug Lamborn on the House floor to discuss the Holy Bible and its important role in American history. On December 7 , I was honored to join the American Red Cross at their Holiday Mail for Heroes event where I, and other Members of Congress, wrote cards to servicemembers protecting our country overseas. The holiday season marks a particularly important time to highlight our appreciation for the selfless sacrifices of our soldiers to protect America and its principles all around the world. On December 8 , I spoke at the 18th Annual Lakeshore Technical College Legislative Breakfast in Sheboygan about the value of career and technical education (CTE) and the need to shine a light on the many benefits of CTE to younger Americans, like job security and less student loan debt. Looking Onward to 2023 In 2023, I'm excited to have the opportunity to serve you in the Majority in the House of Representatives. As we transition into the 118th Congress, I will continue to bring our Wisconsin values and common-sense solutions to Washington to work in a bipartisan manner to make the Sixth District, Wisconsin, and the whole country a better place to live. I am committed to working on your behalf to rein in spending, enact border security, reduce insulin costs, increase the penalties for trafficking deadly fentanyl, expand career opportunities for individuals with disabilities, and preserve the safety and security of you and your family.

27," 2022 Photos of the Year 2022: A YEAR IN REVIEW First District, we did it! We survived 2022 and two years of one-party Democrat rule in Washington. I'm excited for 2023, for the 118th Congress, and to see what's next for the great state of Georgia. Looking back, there's been a lot of good this year, more than I can fit into a single email. When staff asked me to pull together my favorite photos from each month of the past year, it was a difficult task, but I ended up with the great opportunity to relive 2022 through my photos with you, the residents of Georgia's First Congressional District. From football games to forums and Kings Bay to Bacon County, I've gotten the chance to sit down with thousands of Georgians and hear your stories, successes, concerns, and dreams. Thank you - so much - for making this year one to remember. Cheers to 2023!

Thank you - so much - for making this year one to remember. Cheers to 2023! january I had the pleasure of getting to know Coach Dooley while serving in the Georgia State Legislature and in Congress through his work on historic preservation policy and his trips to Washington. He always commented about how much he enjoyed reading our newsletter every week and, as you can imagine, it made me and our team extremely proud. One of the last times I saw Coach Dooley was at the National Championship game in Indianapolis in January. He was kind enough to allow me and two of my sons to get a picture with him. His only request was that it be in the newsletter that week. It was indeed and this week, in honor of this late Georgia legend, we've included it once more. february This year we had our inaugural ""Firsts of the First"" Valentine's Day appreciation campaign. After gathering Valentine's Day cards from nursing homes, schools, churches, political groups, and more throughout the First District, we went to every single county and delivered them to first responders. We picked this group because while many of us were home during the COVID-19 pandemic, they were out in the communities making sure we were safe and had access to medical care when we needed it. This will now be an annual event but we will rename it to ""Friends of the First"" so that we can show appreciation to different members of the community every year. march This hardly even needs a caption - anyone who's spent more than a minute in Savannah knows about our iconic Saint Patrick's Day celebrations. I look forward to attending these events every year. In fact, this year I was able to attend parades in both Savannah and Tybee. Can't wait to see you all in green again next year! april This photo is a bittersweet one. Bitter because it is a reminder of just how high gas prices got last Spring, but sweet because the First District came together to ensure that Joe Biden knew just how much his inflation crisis was crushing the American people. Ahead of an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, I asked all of you to send me your gas bills, so that the Biden administration could feel your pain at the pump. I presented these during the hearing, along with your stories, and sent the hundreds that I couldn't fit on one poster board to the White House. MAY To commemorate National Police Week, I went to the National Law Enforcement Memorial in downtown Washington where we had a Back the Blue Wreath Laying led by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. I was honored to lay a wreath at the wall with the inscription of the name of Sgt. Kelvin Ansari, a Savannah Police officer who was killed in the line of duty three years ago to the week that this wreath was laid. june In June, I took my fifth trip to the southern border since being elected to Congress (five more than the Commander-in-Chief). During this visit with the House Budget Committee, I was honored to meet several members of Georgia's National Guard. Because of the crisis at our southern border, Governor Kemp has deployed our states' national guard to go assist the border patrol agents in their endless fight to slow the flood of illegal immigration. To everyone in Georgia's National Guard, and all branches of the military, thank you for your service! JULY This year's Fourth of July celebrations were ones for the books. I'm not sure why I've always loved this holiday. Maybe it's because I love parades or maybe it's because I love this country so much - the greatest country this world has ever known that has given me the opportunity to live the American Dream. Whatever the reason, I just know I love celebrating July 4th, especially in South and Coastal Georgia. I was lucky enough to make it to Independence Day events in St. Mary's, St. Simon's, St. George, Brunswick, Richmond Hill, Rincon, and Screven this year. AUGUST After a record-high number of attacks on pregnancy care centers this year, I visited several in the District and had listening sessions to hear more about the services they provide and how the federal government can support their mission to provide health care access to mothers and babies. The work they do is vital, is it often free, and it educates families on the options available to them when it comes to planning for their futures. On this day, I went to Skylark Pregnancy Center in Brunswick, where I had a wonderful conversation with the workers and learned, once again, how important pregnancy care centers are to our health care system. SEPTEMBER I had the honor of being the keynote speaker at the Third Infantry Division and Local Law Enforcement 9/11 Patriots Day ceremony. As I spoke of my personal memories of that awful day, looking around the room at the young people present, it occurred to me that many of our youth were born after 9/11/01 and have no memory of this awful event. The importance of us continuing to memorialize 9/11 cannot be overstated. I remember it like it were yesterday. I was at work, when my secretary came up to me and said, ""did you hear about that building falling into the river?"" Now, at the time, there was construction down on River Street in Savannah, so I assumed that's what she was referring to. Little did I know, it was the largest terrorist attack ever on American soil. It was surreal, as I'm sure all of us with memories of that day can agree. God bless America and God bless our troops. OCTOBER In October, I unveiled the Pulling Back the Curtain report to educate people on the ways that Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) artificially spike prescription drug prices without providing any real value to consumers. They are the pharmaceutical industry's middlemen, preying on the lack of transparency in the healthcare industry and robbing patients blind. This was an incredibly special event because, in addition to welcoming several guests from across the country to share their experiences battling PBMs for necessary health care, I got to unveil this project in the same place where I opened my pharmacies decades ago. I am optimistic that, in the 118th Congress, we'll finally see some real progress on this issue. NOVEMBER In November, I went to Riceboro in Liberty County where I visited the recently completed Early Childhood Education Center that includes Head Start, a childcare program administered through the Coastal Georgia Area Community Action Authority that serves children six weeks to five years old. With a total student population capacity of 234, the program has 14 classrooms and serves nine counties in the region, including seven in the First Congressional District. I've said it several times before, but spending time with children - the next generation of leaders - is one of the most rewarding and important parts of my job. Who knows, I might've taken this picture with a future GA-01 Congressman! DECEMBER We've made it to December! I had the honor of speaking at the Brunswick/Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce breakfast. At this event, I gave an update on the work we've been up to in Washington, especially as it relates to the business community, and shared my hopes for the next Congress. That's why it felt so fitting to end on this image, because it sums up the year in a great way - by recognizing our District's growth, achievements, and path forward.

28," As the holiday season ends and the year comes to a close, I'd like to thank you for staying up to date on my work for you in Congress. Below you will find a year-in-review with highlights of my efforts to secure funding for our communities and ensure that my constituents have a voice in the federal government. It is my utmost privilege to represent the 23 rd Congressional District of Texas, and I look forward to advocating for your priorities in 2023. Happy New Year to you and your family! In 2022, my team and I worked hard to help constituents get the federal assistance they deserve. Through our casework process, my office solved 781 cases and helped return $3,620,612 from agencies like the IRS and the Social Security Administration. Navigating federal casework can be overwhelming... that's why we are always here to help. For assistance, please call my office at 210-806-9920. My veterans casework team closed 127 cases with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) just this year. As a Navy Veteran, I know how difficult it can be to utilize the many resources available to us. It is important that the men and women who have selflessly served our nation have access to each and every benefit they deserve. Solving our border crisis requires input from border communities, which is why I have hosted over 90 congressional members in TX-23. From field visits with law enforcement to roundtables with local officials, I have worked hard to bring light to the failures of our broken immigration system. By inviting my colleagues to see these realities for themselves, we can craft solutions that take border communities into account. In Washington, I have introduced, voted on, and passed legislation to benefit b oth our district and our nation. This includes legislation focused on securing our southern border, advocating for veterans, and ensuring schools are safe havens for our children. In 2022, I was able to secure $62,295,454 for community projects across Texas' 23 rd Congressional District. These local projects will directly benefit TX-23 communities in areas ranging from border security to improved healthcare to military housing and preparedness. For more details, click here . New year, new office! We have officially moved into our new Washington D.C. office. We are now located in Rayburn, suite number 2244. Next time you are in town, be sure to stop by! In 2023, I will continue to fight to address your concerns and protect our liberties. From my family to yours, we wish you all a safe and happy New Year! Sincerely, Rep.

Thanks to Congressional Democrats and President Biden, there are dozens of historic accomplishments to celebrate! We passed the most significant infrastructure and climate investments in U.S. history. We also cemented marriage equality for LGBTQ+ and interracial couples, and passed the first gun violence prevention legislation in decades. Of course, we couldn't have delivered for the people of Maine's First District without my hardworking staff, who have helped thousands of constituents this year. In addition to helping Mainers get passports, visas, veterans and Social Security benefits, my staff helped get more than $1 million in total refunds to Maine taxpayers - isn't that amazing?

36,"As this year comes to a close, I wanted to highlight some moments from 2022. View this email in your browser ( ** 2022 Year in Review ------------------------------------------------------------ December 31, 2022 Neighbors, As this year comes to a close, I wanted to highlight some moments from 2022. In March of this year, I held a press conference ( with local officials, energy producers, and oil field workers to hold Governor Newsom and President Biden accountable for their anti-oil and natural gas policies which are not only hurting our local economy and threatening local energy-related jobs, but are also weakening America's energy independence. In May, I led ( a bipartisan group of my colleagues in the House and local officials to the Sequoia National Forest, one of the only places in the world where giant sequoias naturally grow, to show them the devastation caused by wildfires firsthand. We all agree that Congress must do more to save these natural wonders, which is why I introduced the bipartisan Save Our Sequoias Act. You can learn more about this bill here ( . Congratulations to this year's 23rd Congressional District Merit Award and Inspirational High School Educator Award recipients. These students and teachers were nominated and recognized for their exceptional efforts to foster community inside and outside the classroom. I was honored to personally present these amazing students and teachers with their awards. Annually, I participate in the Congressional Art Competition, which highlights ( some of our community's emerging artists. This year's pieces were exceptional. A big congratulations to the overall winner, Lily, on her piece, Want some? Lily's artwork is now proudly showcased in the U.S. Capitol. One thing that sets our community apart from the rest is the immense gratitude we show our active duty servicemembers, veterans, and their families, as well as the reverence and solemn respect for those who sadly lost their lives while protecting our great nation. I was fortunate to participate in several events this year to honor our heroes, including the Parade of 1000 Flags in Ridgecrest and the dedication of the new Kern County World War II Veterans Memorial in Bakersfield. I am proud to have appointed a new class of nominees to our country's U.S. Service Academies. These students have made the honorable decision to pursue higher education while attending one of our country's Service Academies. I know that they will make our community proud in their service to our country! This July I was privileged to participate in a ceremony celebrating Elaine King, a Rosie the Riveter, and Charlie Wilson, an Army Air Corps veteran, on their profound service and dedication to protecting the American way of life. After years of bureaucratic red tape, I was proud to take part in the groundbreaking ceremony ( of the Success Reservoir Enlargement Project at Schafer Dam. This project will raise the Schafer Dam spillway by 10 feet to reduce the risk of flooding below the dam and to increase storage capacity at Success Reservoir by 28,000 acre-feet, bringing its total capacity to 110,000 acre-feet. This additional water storage capacity is critical to our communities' families and agriculture producers. In October, I held a roundtable ( with local law enforcement officials, school officials, parents, and health care providers to discuss the ongoing fentanyl epidemic and the threat that this deadly drug poses to our communities. I am working with local and regional stakeholders to develop legislation to help stop the flow of illegal fentanyl into our communities and schools. This fall, I had the privilege to welcome Honor Flight Kern County on their visit to Washington, D.C., and give them a tour of the U.S. Capitol Building. I always feel humbled listening to their stories of bravery and devout patriotism. It continues to be a privilege of a lifetime for me to serve you in Congress, and I look forward to continuing to represent many of you beginning on January 3, 2023 in the new 20th Congressional District. I would like to thank the constituents, communities, and friends that I have gotten to know but will no longer be able to represent due to the changes in redistricting lines - it has been an honor to represent you! ============================================================ Office of Congressman Kevin McCarthy ** Matt Sparks (mailto: @ ) , ** Brittany Martinez (mailto: @ ) 661-327-3611 ** ( ) ** ( ** ( ** ( ** ( ** ( ** Sign up for email updates ( Copyright © 2022 Congressman Kevin McCarthy, All rights reserved.

38,"Senator Kyrsten Sinema Dear  , Wishing you and your loved ones a very safe, healthy, and happy new year! As we look ahead to 2023, I promise to stay laser-focused on my top priority: getting stuff done for 2022, we got *a lot* done thanks to collaboration on both sides of the political aisle that?s largely unheard of in today?s era of bitter Washington partisanship. It?s no secret that some in Washington haven?t always liked my approach ? but Arizonans know that it?s produced real, long-lasting results to some of the most challenging issues facing our state and nation. Let?s review some of the landmark victories we?ve proudly ushered into law in 2022 alone: * Postal Service Reform Act ?Providing much-needed investments to ensure all Arizonans receive their mail on time. * Reauthorized Violence Against Women Act ? Protecting Arizona women, combating domestic violence, and cracking down on abusers. * Shadow Wolves Enhancement Act ? Reclassifying the Tohono O?odham Shadow Wolves as special agents, allowing them to better patrol and secure the border, keeping Arizonans safe while respecting the Nation?s tribal sovereignty. * Bipartisan Safer Communities Act ?Making historic investments in mental health resources and school and community violence prevention following the horrific shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. * CHIPS and Science Act ? Restoring Arizona and America?s leadership in domestic semiconductor manufacturing, creating thousands of good-paying jobs, cutting supply chain delays, and boosting our national security by reducing reliance on foreign nations. * PACT Act ?Expanding critical benefits and health care access for veterans exposed to toxic substances while serving ? a key tenant of our responsibility to care for our veterans who have sacrificed so much in service to our nation. * Inflation Reduction Act ?Delivering critical resources to mitigate Arizona?s historic drought conditions, including $4 billion in drought relief for the American West, and lowering the costs of prescription drugs for Arizona seniors. * Respect for Marriage Act ? Ensuring same-sex and interracial couples enjoy the same protections as all other marriages, while respecting America?s core value of religious freedom. * DHS Illicit Cross-Border Tunnel Defense Act ? Cracking down on cartels? criminal activity by directing CBP to identify, intercept, and seal off cross-border tunnels used to smuggle drugs, weapons, and people across our border. And so much more. I was also honored to travel all across the state to have conversations with Arizonans about the issues that matter most, and detail the historic investments I?ve secured for our state this year. From Phoenix to Yuma, Page to Safford, Flagstaff to Tucson, Lake Mead to Lake Powell, Sonoita to Winslow, Goodyear to Prescott ? I?ve heard from Arizonans in every corner of our state about what they want to see from their elected leaders. What I?ve heard is a deep desire to move beyond the partisan politics and make real progress on the challenges and opportunities facing our state.  , that?s exactly how I?ve governed since being elected, and that?s how I?ll always work to deliver long-lasting results for our state and country.

40," Dear West Virginian, What a year it's been! As we turn the page into 2023, it's important that we recommit ourselves to our shared goal and mission of making West Virginia all that it is truly destined to be. Doing so will help us continue to move our communities and state as a whole forward. Keep scrolling for some photo highlights from 2022! January In January, I visited Huntington Tri-State Airport to tour new facilities that are part of Marshall University's Aviation Maintenance Technician program , which is helping drive the aerospace industry right here in West Virginia. Later in the year, I secured $1,000,000 award to support aviation training at the program. Learn more about that announcement here . February In February, I joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues in announcing the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) , which expired in 2018. I have consistently supported the Violence Against Women Act , and voted to reauthorize this critical legislation twice. In conversations with local leaders in West Virginia, they conveyed that the funding and support VAWA provides to local organizations working to combat domestic violence in our state is a ""lifeline"" to the work they do. March In March, I joined Governor Jim Justice, Congresswoman Carol Miller, and state and local officials in Fayetteville, . to mark the announcement of the redevelopment of the town's schoolhouses, which were renovated and built as boutique hotel rooms and new apartments. Since the redesignation of New River Gorge as a National Park and Preserve , Fayetteville has seen a major increase in visitors. April In April, I met with Marshall Football Head Coach Charles Huff and spoke with the team. Congratulations to the Thundering Herd on the 9-4 finish and a win in the Myrtle Beach Bowl. WE ARE…MARSHALL! May In May, joined a group of my colleagues to again discuss the impacts of record high gas and energy prices on working West Virginians. This is a topic I've spoken on repeatedly, asking President Biden to finally prioritize domestic energy production and work to return the United States to energy independence. June In June, I visited Mountain Steer Meat Company in White Sulphur Springs, . where I toured their facilities and met with the owners. During the pandemic, the Tuckwillers and Fords, two local families, came up with an innovative approach to improve and grow the meat processing business right here in Greenbrier County. July In July, we honored Hershel ""Woody"" Williams , the last surviving World War II Medal of Honor recipient, during a lying in honor ceremony in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. Woody was also honored with a wreath laying ceremony at the World War II Memorial on the National Mall. Woody is the seventh American and first West Virginian to lie in honor in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. We will always remember his courage, service, and sacrifice! August In August, I joined Dr. Ali Rezai, Director of the Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute (RNI) and Hoppy Kercheval, host of MetroNews Talkline, for a special interview on Alzheimer's disease and dementia . During the interview, I shared my personal experience as a caretaker for my parents who struggled with Alzheimer's disease, as well as my continued efforts to assist families in West Virginia going through similar circumstances. September In September, I brought Dana Perino , author and co-anchor of FOX News Channel's America's Newsroom and The Five , to Morgantown, . to promote female empowerment, education, fitness, and self-confidence. First, we traveled to Suncrest Elementary School where we met with fifth and fourth grade female students as part of my Girls Rise Up program . Later, we visited the West Virginia University (WVU) Reed College of Media where we hosted a luncheon with WVU female leadership, staff, and students to discuss female empowerment. October In October, I made several stops across the state, one of which was for the grand opening ceremony for Clorox Company's new Fresh Step® Cat Litter Plant in Martinsburg! November In November, I was elected by my Senate Republican colleagues to serve as the Vice Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference . It's so important that we listen more to the men and women across our country raising families and working hard to strengthen America, especially as we strive together to address the challenges we face. I am committed to doing just that, and look forward to working with my colleagues to help communicate our optimistic vision for the future. December In December, we celebrated the second anniversary of New River Gorge's establishment as a National Park and Preserve! Since the redesignation, visitor spending in communities near the Park and Preserve resulted in a $35.2 million benefit to the state's economy and supported 1,090 jobs in West Virginia. In 2021, nearly 1.7 million park visitors spent an estimated $82.6 million in local gateway regions while visiting the New River Gorge National Park and Preserve, with 88.1% of visitors from out-of-state. We are just getting started! Learn more here . Looking forward to a great year ahead! Join me on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram for regular updates and photos.

41," News from Representative DeGette ABOUT DIANA SERVICES ISSUES NEWSROOM STUDENTS CONTACT ME Dear Friend, As we look ahead to start of 2023, I wanted to take a moment to look back at some of the progress we made in 2022. This past year, Congress passed historic legislation to lower health care costs for millions of Americans and to make the largest-ever federal investment to take on the climate crisis. No longer will seniors have to pay more than $2,000 a year out of pocket for their prescription medications, or more than $35 a month for the insulin they need. And the investments that are now being made to combat the climate crisis will put us on track to reduce our overall carbon emissions by more than 40 percent by the end of this decade. As chair of the House Energy & Commerce's Oversight and Investigations panel, my colleagues and I took on the oil companies who were raking in record high profits while hardworking families were paying record high prices at the pump. And we took steps to hold the nation's baby formula manufacturers accountable as a nationwide shortage left millions of parents struggling to find the formula they needed to feed their children. And - on goals I've long championed - Congress passed legislation that made significant progress in our fight to take on some of the nation's biggest polluters and ensure environmental justice for all. And just a few weeks ago, members of the House and Senate came together and passed legislation to protect marriage equality to ensure that every American has the right to marry who they love. To help those experiencing homelessness in our city, I secured nearly $40 million to fund more than a dozen projects in the Denver area - including $2 million to convert the Stay Inn Hotel into more housing for those experiencing homelessness and $3 million to help build a new shelter for homeless youth in our area. My goal in 2023 is to continue building upon this progress that we've made. I'm going to continue pushing to enact the commonsense gun-safety measures to better protect our communities - including my legislation to ban the sale of high-capacity gun magazines nationwide; as well as legislation to get these semiautomatic assault rifles off our streets once and for all. As co-chair of the House Pro-Choice Caucus, I'm going to continue fighting to ensure all Americans have access to the abortion care they need by restoring the protections we had under Roe v. Wade nationwide. I'm also going to continue our effort to preserve more of Colorado's pristine wilderness for future generations to enjoy, and to lower the cost of insulin for all Americans. As always, if you have any questions about these or any other issue, please call my office at 303-844-4988, or visit my website at where you can learn more about how my staff is available to assist you. I wish you and your family nothing but the best in the new year!

42," News from Representative Steil December 31, 2022 Constituent Services Update Friend, I'm eager to start the new year and get to work on the issues most important to you. As costs remain high and crime continues to impact our communities, I'm focused on lowering costs and making our communities safe. I also remain focused on helping you. If you or someone you know is experiencing difficulty working with the federal government, contact my office. In the last year, my office heard from thousands of you. Thank you for your continued outreach to my office, I look forward to continuing to communicate with each of you. Spending and Inflation You deserve a transparent government. Wasteful government spending harms us all. When Washington fails to live within its means, it leads to higher costs, taxes, and it threatens vital programs like Social Security and Medicare. I will never stop working to weed out government waste so that we can focus on the priorities of the American people. In the last year, this is how the federal government spent your tax dollars: In the last two years, the federal government has passed $6.8 trillion in new spending and our National Debt has surpassed $90,000 per citizen. The result? Wisconsin's inflation rate sits around 14.1% , costing families an additional $688 per month, plus higher energy costs coming this winter. This is unsustainable. We need to get spending under control to address rising costs, unleash American energy, and help people get back to work. These are three simple policy solutions that Congress should be focused on. Congress must implement an all of the above approach, and increase American energy production. Fighting Fentanyl and Keeping us Safe Fentanyl is the leading cause of death for individuals aged 18-45. Fentanyl has devastated our community. In 2021, fentanyl killed: 508 people in Milwaukee County 68 people in Racine County 48 people in Kenosha County 47 people in Rock County *Walworth County data not available at this time This year, I hosted multiple roundtables across the district to raise awareness about fentanyl and how it is poisoning our communities. To stop it, we need to secure the border, fund law enforcement, get criminals off our streets, and make illicit fentanyl a Schedule I drug Reopening the People's House and Holding Government Accountable In part, the First Amendment says: ""Congress shall make no law…prohibiting…the right of the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."" Since March 2020, that hasn't been fully possible due to the people's House being mostly closed to the public. It's time to fully re-open. I'm working on reopening to People's House to best serve the public. The Federal Government should be accessible, transparent, and accountable to the American people. It's past time that we re-open the People's House for families to speak with their Representatives, visit the U.S. Capitol building, and take part in our democracy in action, Honoring Our Veterans and Their Families Our state is home to over 340,000 veterans, including 42,000 in southeastern Wisconsin alone. Each week, our office hears from Veterans and their families experiencing difficulty working with the VA. We're here to help. After a veteran's daughter from Burlington came to my office and told me the VA was demanding she return earned benefits, we sprang into action. The result was introducing the Survivor Benefits Fairness Act to ensure that no family ever has to return rightly deserved benefits to the VA after a family member's passing, Supporting Students and Giving Parents a Voice Students are averaging seven percentage points lower in math scores and five percentage points lower in reading scores post-pandemic. That's two decades of progress in math and reading…gone. It's unacceptable. We should make sure every student can succeed and give parents a voice. I've been proud to support both public schools and policies that expand choices for students in Wisconsin. I support creating a Parents a Bill of Rights to ensure parents have a voice in their children's education. The Parents Bill of Rights includes: Right to know what's being taught in schools Right to see school budget and spending Right to protect their child's privacy Right to be updated an any activity at school Protecting Social Security and Medicare Our nation's inflation rate sits around 7%, making affording the things seniors need more difficult. As the cost of everything continues to rise, critical programs including Social Security and Medicare are put further at risk. We must protect Social Security and Medicare. I'm committed to lowering costs for seniors, including prescription drug prices through legislation I cosponsored to make prices more transparent, and by stopping spending proposals in Washington that put these programs at risk. Happy New Year! I hope you and your family were able to enjoy Christmas and can ring in the new year with friends and family. The last year has been challenging for families across Wisconsin. I remain grateful for the blessings we all enjoy, and hopeful for the new year. If you need assistance or have questions or concerns, always feel free to reach out.

44," This past year hasn't been easy-historic inflation is making everyday life more expensive; the COVID pandemic is approaching its third year; illegal immigration is surging; and the devolution of our critical societal institutions seems to make us more divided than ever. Internationally, Putin's unlawful and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine wages on and the Chinese Communist Party watches the global response closely as they evaluate options with regards to Taiwan. Amid these difficulties, 2022 was also a year of great legislative achievements. Senator Romney worked effectively to advance his priorities for Utah and for the nation, including efforts to save the Great Salt Lake and address Utah's drought problem; reign in spending and the national debt; bolster our decaying infrastructure; better support working families; assist Ukraine in its effort to defeat Russia; and counter the rising threat posed by China. Keep scrolling for a recap of Senator Romney's 2022, as told through photos: The United States Senate is one of our vital democratic institutions, and the power given to the minority in the Senate and the resulting requirement for political consensus are among the Senate's defining features. Senator Romney speaks on the Senate floor regarding the Democrats' attempts to remake our government institutions by eliminating the filibuster. The Olympics display the greatest qualities of the human spirit. At a gathering in Park City with returned athletes and families of athletes, Senator Romney cheers on Team USA during the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Remaining competitive with China will require significant investments in our country's manufacturing capacity. Senator Romney visits Nucor's steel operation in Plymouth, Utah, which helps counter China's predation in the global steel market. China is taking note of the global response to what is happening in Ukraine, which is why the U.S. must help Ukraine defend itself. Senator Romney leads his colleagues in pressing the Biden Administration to expedite the transfer of aircraft and air defense systems, as well as additional support capabilities, to Ukraine. Senator Romney walks into his office adorned with toilet paper-a surprise gift from his staff to celebrate his 75th birthday! Following its four-year renovation, Senator Romney hosts a bipartisan group of his colleagues for a tour of the Washington D.C. Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The bipartisan infrastructure bill, which Senator Romney helped negotiate, secured funding to bring running water to the nearly half of the Navajo Nation in Utah who have lacked it. Romney joins leaders from the federal government, Utah, and the Navajo Nation for the signing of the Navajo Utah Water Rights Settlement Agreement in Monument Valley. With Putin's unprovoked war raging in their home country, the Ukrainian National Curling Team relocated to Utah for a safe place to live and train. Senator Romney curls with the Team at the Utah Olympic Oval in Kearns after working with the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee to bring them to Utah. Utah's recreation industry is a significant economic driver for our state. Senator Romney meets with Glen Canyon National Recreation Area Superintendent Billy Shott to discuss meaningful solutions to address the low water access at Lake Powell, which has become a major concern for Utah's recreation industry. Despite being the bedrock of our country, there's perhaps never been a more challenging time than today to raise a family. Senator Romney sits down with American Enterprise Institute (AEI) President Robert Doar to discuss his Family Security Act 2.0 , which aims to reform existing, complex federal programs into one straightforward pro-family, pro-life, and pro-work benefit. With the Great Salt Lake currently at the lowest levels ever recorded, we must do whatever is necessary to save it. Senator Romney and Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson tour the Great Salt Lake on an airboat to have a firsthand look at the implications of a receding lake. The two have partnered on efforts at the federal and state level to address the Lake's lowering water volume. The U.S. cannot rely on countries like China for minerals critical to our national security. Senator Romney tours Rio Tinto's Kennecott copper mining operation in Bingham Canyon to discuss the need for reforms our natural resources permitting process to make it easier to mine critical minerals in our country. The climate crisis is one of the foremost global challenges we face. During a tour of Rocky Mountain Power's Blundell Geothermal Plant in Beaver County, Senator Romney discusses Utah's leading role in finding sustainable energy solutions. Current geopolitical threats from countries like China underscore the importance of our strong alliances. Senator Romney meets with Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Melanie Joly for a discussion on U.S.-Canada relations. Amid Utah's historic drought, Senator Romney tours the Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility to learn more about their efforts to get water back to into Utah's rivers and into the Great Salt Lake. Senator and Mrs. Romney enjoy showing Senator and Mrs. Manchin around the Beehive State, including a hike to Utah's infamous Delicate Arch at Arches National Park. Senator Romney takes a selfie with a group of Salem Hills High School students visiting Washington, D.C. Instead of spending billions of dollars to do things that won't affect global CO2 and methane emissions, the U.S. should focus on new technologies to help bring down global emissions. Senator Romney joins Washington Post reporter Leigh Ann Caldwell to discuss U.S. investments in clean energy innovation, the need to focus on global climate solutions, prospects for bipartisan cooperation, and his efforts to address Utah's unique climate challenges like saving the Great Salt Lake.

45," Open in browser Plain text version All We've Accomplished Together in 2022 Dear Neighbor, I hope this message finds you and your loved ones safe and healthy during this holiday season. As 2022 comes to a close, I'd like to share a brief recap of our policy work over the past year and highlight some of our collective accomplishments. My team and I have worked in close partnership with community to advance meaningful policies and budgets that address the hurt and harm in our communities and lay the groundwork for an equitable recovery that leaves no one behind. Cancelling Student Debt and Lowering Costs for Families We spent years organizing, mobilizing, and advocating for President Biden to use his executive authority to cancel student debt, and I was thrilled President Biden took historic action earlier this year. President Biden's plan to cancel up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt will help millions of people make ends meet, build generational wealth, grow their families, purchase homes, and more. This relief is currently on hold due to frivolous lawsuits by Republican officials who are doing everything they can to stop it, even for their own constituents. Rest assured, we won't stop pressing until our constituents and families across the nation receive this critical relief the President promised. With communities in Massachusetts and beyond continuing to face layered, overlapping crises, we also fought hard to enact the Inflation Reduction Act , a necessary and long-overdue bill to address the impacts of climate change, reduce prescription drug prices, and lower costs for workers and families. This bill is an important step forward. Advancing Reproductive Justice As Co-Chair of the Pro Choice Caucus' Abortion Rights and Access Task Force, I've always sought to advance policies that affirm abortion care as the human right that it is-especially with Republican legislatures and our extremist, far-right majority Supreme Court stopping at nothing to strip away our bodily autonomy. I was proud that the House passed the Women's Health Protection Act , my bill with Congresswoman Judy Chu, to enshrine abortion rights into federal law, but this legislation was obstructed by Republicans in the Senate due to the Jim Crow filibuster. Despite this devastating setback, I remain as committed as ever to using every tool at our disposal to protect and expand reproductive rights, including working with the White House on executive action . Delivering for our Communities After years of advocacy in partnership with cities, towns, grassroots organizations, and advocates in the Massachusetts 7th, my team and I were proud to secure nearly $22 million in federal community project funding to build a more just and equitable district. We visited each municipality to celebrate the Fiscal Year 2022 projects supporting workforce development at La Colaborativa in Chelsea; a new school-based community health center at Randolph High School; tuition-free community college in Boston; green jobs training at the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology; culturally responsive learning at Randolph Public Schools; substance use treatment and programming at The Dimock Center in Roxbury; flood resiliency for Everett and Chelsea; separated bike lanes in Cambridge; climate resiliency and community space in Somerville; and math and learning assessment tools for Milton Public Schools. And just days ago, President Biden signed the Fiscal Year 2023 budget, which included our 15 projects for the Massachusetts 7th . These projects will support investments in trauma-informed healthcare, workforce development, affordable housing, equity in education, environmental justice, and more. I look forward to delivering these vital resources so communities across the district have the means to not only survive, but to thrive. Keeping Those Closest to the Pain, Closest to the Power I've always believed that the people closest to the pain should always be closest to the power, driving and informing our policymaking. That's why I'm so encouraged by the progress we've made this year to boost mental health support for survivors of natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other tragedies; end race-based hair discrimination ; honor survivors of homicide victims nationwide; help grandfamilies access affordable and age-appropriate housing; expand access to treatment for folks suffering from Long COVID ; address the credit issues faced by trans and nonbinary folks who legally change their names ; and more. Each of these bills was developed with and informed by those most impacted. Contact Our Office or Get in Touch via our Website I am so proud of all we've accomplished in 2022 and honored to stand alongside you as we develop policy solutions and continue fighting for the relief our communities in the Massachusetts 7th need and deserve. As always, my team and I are ready to support you in any way we can, so please don't hesitate to give us a call at 617-850-0040 or visit our website at if we can be of assistance. Wishing you and your family happy holidays and look forward to what 2023 will bring.

46," 2022 Year-In-Review 2022 In Review Dear  , As 2022 draws to a close, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on this past year with you. From the hardships we have overcome to the milestones we have achieved, I'm incredibly proud of everything we have accomplished. Together, we set out to defend democracy here at home and abroad, fight climate change, help our economy recover, and protect the rights of all Americans. While I'm proud of the work we've done, rest assured, there is much more I intend to achieve for our community in the new year. 2022 In Review Dear   , As 2022 draws to a close, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on this past year with you.

While I'm proud of the work we've done, rest assured, there is much more I intend to achieve for our community in the new year. Rep. Quigley speaks to the crowd at the AIDS Run/Walk in October 2022. Serving My Constituents I am pleased to report that my staff and I successfully handled and closed 1,458 cases for constituents in 2022. I also had the pleasure of attending over 37 community meetings, recovered over $674,272 for Illinoisans in fees from federal agencies, and responded to over 33,480 letters and phone calls. I've worked hard to bring direct funding home to our district. I was proud to successfully secure $16,532,425 in funding for fifteen projects in our community. From modernizing the Black Ensemble Theater Cultural Center and extending the 606 trail, to providing law enforcement with better equipment and supporting the AIDS Foundation of Chicago, each of these projects will make a measurable difference for our community. Rep. Quigley meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, Ukraine in July 2022. Defending Our Allies In February, we all witnessed the horrors of Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine. As Co-Chair of the Ukraine Caucus, I was proud to be one of the first and most steadfast advocates for providing Ukraine the assistance they need to win this war. In July, I traveled to Ukraine to meet with President Zelenskyy himself, and see the situation on the ground. In our meeting, I assured him that the United States would not give up until Putin ends this illegal war-I intend to keep my word. Since the invasion began, the U.S. has delivered $19.3 billion in military aid, $1.5 billion in humanitarian aid, and $13 billion in financial aid. This aid has been critical to Ukraine's success in this war. I will continue to be a vocal supporter of providing Ukraine what they need to keep fighting, ultimately bring this war to an end, and hold Putin accountable for his crimes. Rep. Quigley joins hls colleagues in a show of support for protecting reproductive rights in May 2022. Protecting Americans' Rights The Supreme Court's outrageous decision to ignore decades-old precedent and overturn Roe shook me and millions of Americans to the core. I have been and will always be a fierce advocate for reproductive freedom. Democrats swiftly responded by passing multiple bills to protect access to abortion and contraception. While these bills have not received a vote in the Senate, I will continue fighting to codify these rights into federal law. Justice Clarence Thomas's concurring opinion this summer raised the prospect that other hard-won civil rights might be in danger. That's why I was proud to co-sponsor and vote for the Respect for Marriage Act to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and protect same-sex and interracial marriage. President Biden signed this bill into law on December 13, and in the process, signaled to the entire country that love will always win. Moving forward, I will continue working to defend marriage equality and protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. Rep. Quigley with Brian Wallach, a prominent leader in the ALS Community and founder of I AM ALS, in October 2022. Fighting ALS At the end of 2021, President Biden signed my bill, ACT for ALS into law. This marked a turning point in the effort to find treatments and develop a cure for ALS. But the work didn't end there. I was proud to secure $27.5 million for ALS research in the Fiscal Year 2022 spending package and to support an FY23 spending package that contains a total of $80 million for ALS. The National Institutes of Health also created grants this year to make promising drugs available to people living with ALS. Together, we're making real progress in the fight to end ALS. Protecting Animals and First-Responders Earlier this month, Congress passed my bill, the Big Cat Public Safety Act, and just last week it was signed into law by President Biden! For too long, lax laws have allowed private citizens to own big cats like lions and tigers. My legislation, now law, will outlaw the private ownership of lions, tigers, panthers, and cheetahs, and ensure they are only kept at highly-qualified facilities that can safely care for them. Big cats are wild creatures-they should not be subjected to a life of abuse for cheap entertainment. Thanks to my legislation, the threat of one of these cats escaping will no longer loom over our communities. These cats will be safer, and so will we. I was proud to see my colleagues from both sides of the aisle come together to push this bill over the finish line. Rep. Quigley during his Climate-Change Tour of Yosemite National Park in July 2022. Combatting Climate Change This year, I led my seventh climate change tour to Yosemite National Park, where I saw the impacts of climate change on our environment firsthand. Rising temperatures are leading to longer fire seasons, drought, and an influx of invasive species. As more climate disasters ravage our country, the need for action has become more and more urgent. Luckily, Democrats in Congress are united in this effort, and we passed historic climate legislation in 2022. In August, Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act , a once-in-a-generation package that delivers the most significant action on climate in history, all while reducing the national deficit by more than $300 billion. This bill invests more than $300 billion in energy and climate reform by investing in growing our renewable energy infrastructure, and providing tax credits for cleaner technology. American families now have access to rebates and tax credits for switching to cleaner energy sources like rooftop solar panels and electric vehicles. All together, these investments will lower greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by the end of the decade, finally putting our climate goal of cutting pollution in half firmly within reach. Gun Violence Prevention This year, our country was once again ravaged by the gun violence epidemic. The mass shooting just next door in Highland Park brought home just how urgently needed common-sense gun reform measures are. In June, I joined 233 of my colleagues in passing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which President Biden signed into law two days later. This bill will fully fund state red flag laws, enhance background checks for 18-20-year-olds, and provide funding for mental health services and community-based violence prevention. However, it is clear to me that these measures are just one piece of the puzzle--they are not a comprehensive solution to curtail gun violence and mass shootings in America. Stronger legislation is still sorely needed, and in the 118th Congress, I hope to work with my colleagues to push for stronger reform. As always, I hope you will take the time to share your opinion with me.

Amidst record high inflation and economic and societal challenges, my office was able to achieve success and deliver relief to our community and our nation. My top priority remains serving the people in our district, and this year alone I've helped over 500 constituents with federal casework, and responded to over 3,000 calls, emails, and letters. SUPPORTING OUR MILITARY Our servicemembers and their families deserve better pay and quality of life, and I've been fighting in Congress to provide that. Last week, my bill, the Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act , passed both the House and Senate as a part of H.R. 7939 and is now headed to the president's desk to be signed into law. 34% of military spouses require a professional license and with military spouse unemployment over 20%, this legislation is critical to our heroic military families. This bill will finally give military families another tool to secure a sound financial future. Additionally, I introduced the Prioritizing Troops Over Tax Collectors Act, which would increase servicemember base pay to the equivalent of $15 an hour ($31,200 per year) by reallocating the $80 billion appropriated to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the Inflation Reduction Act to instead go towards this raise. If we want to attract the talent our military needs, we must be willing to make the investments necessary to attract new servicemembers. SECURING FUNDS FOR COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENT As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I've been able to secure over $16 million in federal funding for projects that will greatly benefit our community, including over $6 million for infrastructure improvements, over $2.7 million for local hospitals, and $3 million to improve educational labs at the College of the Canyons. FIGHTING INFLATION This year, California families have struggled with sky-rocketing inflation and too many have been forced to choose between buying gas or groceries. I introduced the Inflation Prevention Act to put a stop to reckless federal spending habits and rein in inflation. I also voted against the far left's misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, and called on Governor Newsom to suspend the gas tax. ERADICATING ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROWS Last year, I brought national attention to illegal marijuana grows in the Antelope Valley which led to the largest illegal drug raid in the history of Los Angeles County. One of the roadblocks in fighting this issue has been the $19,000 overtime cap placed on law enforcement. I proposed an amendment to end this overtime cap , and will continue my efforts in Congress to ensure that law enforcement have the resources necessary to eradicate every last illegal grow site. ADDRESSING THE FENTANYL CRISIS The administration's failure to secure our border has enabled a free flow of fentanyl into our country, which is hurting our communities, and has killed over 21 people in Santa Clarita alone. In Congress, I've worked to secure the border by getting law enforcement the tools they need to stay ahead of threats. I co-sponsored the HALT Fentanyl Act, which would reschedule fentanyl as a Schedule 1 narcotic, allowing law enforcement to get this poisonous drug off our streets. COMBATTING THE CCP I've led the effort in Congress to combat an increasingly aggressive Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that poses a generational threat to our nation's security. During a House Appropriations Committee markup, I proposed an amendment to reinstate the FBI's ""China Initiative,"" which would combat the CCP's intellectual property theft that has resulted in the theft of between $400 billion to $600 billion in American intellectual property. LOOKING ONTO 2023 As we ring in the new year, I will continue to do everything in my power to improve the livelihoods of Californians in our district and ensure our community remains safe, secure, and prosperous.

50," News from Representative Speier Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window Click here to open a plain text version of this email December 31, 2022 Dear Friends, After nearly 15 years of service in the U.S. House of Representatives, I am writing to share my final Jackie's Reads newsletter as your Member of Congress. Because so many of you have enjoyed these weekly newsletters, I am planning to continue them in the New Year. Stay tuned. I need to up my IT skills first! It was 44 years ago when I shot five times and left for dead on an airstrip in the jungles of Guyana. I had traveled there as a congressional staffer for then-Congressman Leo Ryan to investigate Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple, and to help constituents who wanted to flee his religious cult. I vowed then that if I survived, I would dedicate my life to public service. I lived and I have served, prioritizing our community while fighting for equality and equity for women, our troops, our LGBTQ communities, and the underrepresented. I've also dedicated my career to eliminating government waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption while protecting whistleblowers, consumers, and our national security. My work at home-from responding to 10,000 casework requests, to sending 435,000 constituent letters, to recovering millions of dollars in VA and Social Security benefits and IRS payments-has been among my most fulfilling. A lot of that work has involved cutting through bureaucratic red tape and employing logic, common sense, empathy, and appreciation to solve problems both large and small. Many of my fondest memories are moments I spent with you at my events like Seniors on the Move, When I Grow Up, Job Hunters' Bootcamps, and my Conversations About America. My gun violence sit-ins and getting arrested for abortion rights are among the highlights of my long, proud congressional career. Being the first Member of Congress to speak publicly and on the House floor about having an abortion and bringing the Me Too movement to Congress by sharing my own story of enduring sexual harassment as a congressional staffer, allowed me to use my own experiences for the benefit of all Americans to live in a more just and equal world. I was able to make monumental and historic changes, including how Congress and the military handle cases of sexual harassment and assault and ensuring our brave servicemembers get the resources and respect they need and deserve. Last week, I secured nearly $17 million in federal funding for 15 local community projects. These projects will help improve the lives of families and individuals, protect the environment, increase access to educational resources, and improve transportation and infrastructure across San Mateo and San Francisco Counties. I was also able to secure more than double the amount of federal dollars the San Francisco Bay receives for restoration efforts to $54 million this year. You can read more about those projects here. As many of you know, I have been a stern critic of the military on issues regarding sexual assault and sexual harassment. I have worked hard to improve the living conditions of service members in Alaska, to address the suicide rate across the military, and to address the needs of the families of servicemembers. Last week, I was deeply honored and moved in two ceremonies in which I was awarded distinguished public service medals by the Army and Navy. Generals Smith and Potter pinned the medals on my lapel. One said, ""steel sharpens steel."" The other talked about the servicewomen who have seen and experienced significant improvements from the policies that I have fought for. Both moments will stay with me always. The list of things I was able to do, and that I still plan to do, is as endless as my gratitude and respect for you. My lifetime of public service will continue at home, where the next chapter in my life will focus on children and families living in poverty in our beautiful San Mateo County-home to billionaires and millionaires, but also the working poor. I hope that you will continue to join me on my journey for justice. One way that we can do that is to ensure we remain informed and educated with verified, factual reporting. As I have said for many years, by doing this and working together we can and will continue to overcome all obstacles. Wishing you good health, happiness, and prosperity in the New Year, and all my best always, As a Member of Congress, it is my honor and privilege to share information with my constituents in California's 14th District.

By Bruce Ackerman and Gerard Magliocca, The Washington Post Opinion Bruce Ackerman is a professor of law and political science at Yale and the author of ""Revolutionary Constitutions: Charismatic Leadership and the Rule of Law."" Gerard Magliocca is a professor at Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law and the author of ""American Founding Son: John Bingham and the Invention of the Fourteenth Amendment."" Apart from a relatively brief mention in its 800-page report, the Jan. 6 committee missed the Constitution's preferred punishment for former high officials turned insurrectionists. The committee tries to persuade Americans that criminal prosecution is the only adequate response to Donald Trump's systematic efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Nearly forgotten debates over ratification of the 14th Amendment point to a better, less divisive approach. Nowadays, the amendment is best known for the Section 1 guarantee of ""equal protection of the laws."" At the time of the debates in 1868, however, Section 3 - barring insurrectionists from future elected offices - was the hot-button issue. To read the complete op-ed, click here . More than half of rural California now ranks 'very high' for wildfire hazard By Hayley Smith and Sean Greene, Los Angeles Times For the first time, more than half of California's rural and unincorporated communities could soon be classified as ""very high"" fire hazard severity zones, according to a proposed map from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Officials unveiled the new map - which ranks the likelihood of certain areas to experience wildfire as ""very high,"" ""high"" or ""moderate"" - this month and are taking public comments through February. If approved, nearly 17 million acres will fall under the worst ranking from the Office of the State Fire Marshal, a 14.6% increase since the map was last updated in 2007. The change is largely a reflection of the state's worsening fire activity, said Daniel Berlant, Cal Fire's deputy director of community wildfire preparedness and mitigation. That includes larger, faster and more frequent blazes, many of which are being fueled by a buildup of vegetation and California's warming, drying climate. To read the complete article, click here . Study: Paid family leave in California keeps women in jobs By Grace Gedye, KPBS & Cal Matters If you work in California and your sister is undergoing cancer treatments, or your spouse gets knee surgery, you might be able to get paid while you take time off work to care for them. It's a less well-known part of California's paid family leave benefit, which also covers new parents who leave work to care for and bond with their babies. Although the number of Californians, especially women, using paid leave for reasons beyond new babies has soared in the past two decades, still roughly six times more use paid family leave to care for new children than use it to take care of seriously ill family members While there's broad support for giving new parents paid time off - a benefit that doesn't exist across the U.S. - there's less consensus around paid leave to care for ill family members. At the same time, research on the effects of paid family leave for anyone besides new parents has been limited. A new study published Dec. 12, though, finds that access to paid family leave decreases the likelihood that women leave their job if their spouse has serious health issues.

The West Must Act to Avert War in Nagorno-Karabakh Without a strong-handed referee, Azerbaijan has increasingly moved to resolve its issues by force. By Lara Setrakian, Foreign Policy Lara Setrakian is a journalist and the president of the Applied Policy Research Institute based in Yerevan, Armenia. A woman in a crowd of protesters clutched a lifeless dove in her hand, its head flopping back and forth as she waved her arm in the air. The bird had apparently been squeezed to death while she spoke into a megaphone, delivering an impassioned speech honoring Azerbaijan's victory over Armenia in the 2020 war for Nagorno-Karabakh. With dark humor, the strangled dove came to embody the broken peace process in the South Caucasus. The bird and its human handler were part of a show of political force by Azerbaijan in the Lachin corridor, the sole road connecting Armenians in the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh to the outside world. Since Dec. 12, Azerbaijani protesters have blocked the road with crowds of people and tent encampments, halting the normal movement of people and goods in or out of the enclave. The protests began with specific complaints around the mining of natural resources in areas held by ethnic Armenians. They grew into a broader nationalistic grievance, challenging the role of Russian peacekeepers and pressing for greater controls over Nagorno-Karabakh. To read the complete op-ed, click here .

Follow me on social media @RepKahele! ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ Introducing H.R. 9164 Hawaiian Home Lands Preservation Act This week, I introduced H.R. 9164, the Hawaiian Home Lands Preservation Act. This act would amend the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 and lower the blood quantum requirement to 1/32nd for successor beneficiaries. It is time to right a historical wrong and address this longstanding issue in the native Hawaiian community. U.S. Rep. Kahele speaks on the House Floor about the Hawaiian Home Lands Preservation Act.

52," Thank You & Happy New Year! Have questions? Contact Me Here Thank You for the Opportunity to Serve To every resident of New York's 22nd Congressional District, Happy New Year, and thank you for entrusting me with the great privilege of being your voice in Congress. Representing this great district twice in the United States House of Representatives has been a tremendous honor. I ran for Congress to restore prosperity to our region, and this fight continues. Throughout my two terms representing this district, my staff and I have been honored each day to work tirelessly on your behalf. We have fought special interests to introduce and pass legislation that benefits our community. We have taken on federal agencies to resolve casework matters for those in dire need of assistance. We have nominated dozens of young students to military service academies, many of who have gone on to serve our nation in the Armed Forces. And we have advocated tenaciously for projects that benefit our region, returning millions in federal funding to our community for important and targeted investments in a range of programs, including water infrastructure, health, and law enforcement. We also have prioritized open and transparent public service. I have been honored to explain every vote I take in Congress. Even if we do not always agree, you will always know where I stand on the issues. This term, I have explained more than 400 votes in significant detail . I will continue to prioritize a government that is transparent and accountable to you. One piece of legislation that I was especially honored to introduce this term and will continue to fight for is the Essential Caregivers Act, which works to protect the rights of residents in long-term care facilities by allowing them to access up to two essential caregivers during a public health emergency. During the pandemic, the rights of senior citizens were disregarded, and this legislation will make sure that never happens again. Another priority I will continue to focus on in the New Year is the Election Integrity Caucus , which I founded and currently co-chair. This caucus is focused on delivering commonsense solutions that restore faith in our democratic process. Starting on January 3, 2023, when the 118th Session of Congress begins, I will no longer be representing the 22nd District in Congress. Following New York's redistricting process, I will now be representing New York's 24th District, which includes the portions of Oswego County currently in the 22nd District. Other areas in the current 22nd District will be represented by Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Congressman-Elect Brandon Williams, and Congressman-Elect Marc Molinaro. Additional information on who will be representing you in Congress starting on January 3 can be accessed by visiting . I thank you again for the opportunity to represent you in Congress for two impactful terms. It truly was an honor that I will never forget. I look forward to continuing to be a strong advocate for New York in the 118th Congress, and I wish you and your family a very happy, safe, and healthy New Year. Sincerely, ‌ ‌ ‌ Rep.

53," News from Representative Walberg Open in browser Open in plain text December 31, 2022 Get Connected: Happy New Year! Traveling across every community of Michigan's 7th District in 2022, constituents shared with me a litany of issues that were on their minds. As your representative, I take this feedback with me to Washington. While the new Congress also means I will now represent Michigan's new 5th Congressional District , I will forever cherish the relationships forged over the course of a number of years which are certainly not defined by political boundaries. I look forward to continuing to serve many of you, and look forward to the opportunity to meet new constituents in 2023. America is a beacon of hope and it is worth fighting for. To watch my year-end message, please click here . Opposing Reckless Spending Before Christmas, I voted against the Democrats' massive spending bill, a 4,155-page far-left boondoggle with a $1.7 trillion price tag. This omnibus fails to meaningfully address the border crisis, unleash American energy, or put a check on wasteful spending. The American people have rejected one-party rule and the ongoing reckless spending, which has spurred inflation. It's time to get our fiscal house in order. Protecting Michigan from the CCP Recently, I led a letter urging Governor Whitmer to follow the lead of 16 other states and ban TikTok from Michigan state-issued devices. This is not a partisan issue, but one of national security, and indeed the security and privacy of all Michiganders. To protect Michigan employees and our educational institutions from the threat of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) influence, data collection, and control this is a necessary and commonsense measure to take.

54," Looking Back on 2022 December 31, 2022 Hello Friends,And Happy New Year! I hope you are enjoying some time with family and loved ones this holiday season. As we near the end of 2022, I wanted to take the opportunity to look back on the year and take stock of all that we have accomplished for New Hampshire and our nation. December 31, 2022 Hello Friends, And Happy New Year! I hope you are enjoying some time with family and loved ones this holiday season. As we near the end of 2022, I wanted to take the opportunity to look back on the year and take stock of all that we have accomplished for New Hampshire and our nation. Looking back on 2022, there is so much we accomplished by working together. 2022 came with many challenges - we were dealing with the aftermath of a global pandemic that disrupted supply chains around the world, Russia's brutal war in Ukraine, a recovering economy, mass shootings that shook our communities to their core, and so much more. Yet, in the face of these challenges, Granite Staters stepped up. Bringing Better Jobs to New Hampshire and Strengthening Our Economy I was proud to advocate for New Hampshire in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Package. Before the beginning of this year, we passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Package - game-changing legislation for New Hampshire and communities across the country. From investments in our roads, bridges, and highways to expanded access to high-speed broadband and internet, this package will create high-paying jobs and bring new developments to our state for generations to come. And, in 2023, I will continue working to ensure these federal resources get out the door and into our communities. I was proud to join the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the onsemi facility in Hudson earlier this year which will benefit from the CHIPS and Science Act! Also this year, we passed the CHIPS and Science Act . This comprehensive legislative package makes critical investments in our national security, economy, energy independence, and competitiveness with China. Across industries and regions, our country relies on microchips to function and thrive - but, for too long this critical technology has come from foreign producers. The CHIPS and Science Act changes the status quo and brings this manufacturing back home. I will continue working to implement this package to ensure America remains secure and competitive in the global economy. Lowering Costs for New Hampshire Families and Seniors I will continue pushing for the steps outlined in my Lower Costs and Stronger Economy Agenda in 2023. As our economy and global supply chains continued to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation caused rising prices across the world. I authored my Lower Costs and Stronger Economy Agenda to address higher costs at home and lower prices at the grocery store and the gas station. Click HERE to view my agenda. My agenda is an overview of the action Congress has taken to reduce costs and address inflation, followed by a comprehensive roadmap for what more needs to be done to provide financial relief for Granite Staters. While we have made progress to lower prices, strengthen our supply chains, and increase our workforce, more work remains to ensure no family struggles to afford the necessities to be happy, healthy, and thrive. The government funding package for 2023 further increased home heating assistance for New Hampshire families. The fact is, far too many Granite Staters are struggling with high prices. That's why I fight every day to lower costs and deliver relief to families in New Hampshire. This year, I was proud to help more than double the funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for New Hampshire. LIHEAP is a lifeline for Granite State families that struggle to afford their home heating costs and helps to reduce the burden of high energy costs on New Hampshire households. As we head into the new year, I will continue advocating for increased funding for our communities. This comprehensive legislation took an all-of-the-above approach to lower costs and strengthen our economy. One of the accomplishments I am most proud of this year was the Inflation Reduction Act - transformative legislation to lower costs and invest in the future of our state and our country. The Inflation Reduction Act also took steps to lower energy costs by investing in large-scale clean power to insulate our economy from foreign energy fluctuations. In 2023, Granite Staters can also receive tax credits for purchasing more efficient vehicles - up to a $4,000 tax credit for used clean hybrid and electric vehicles and up to a $7,500 tax credit to buy new clean vehicles. Homeowners are also eligible for a 100% tax credit to install an energy-efficient heating system. Building Safer, Stronger Communities The Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence will continue pushing for the initiatives outlined in our legislative agenda . As a founder and co-chair of the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence and a survivor myself, I know how crucial it is to protect survivors and remove barriers to reporting harassment and violence. This year, we passed meaningful legislation to protect the rights of individuals impacted by domestic and sexual violence. I was proud to see President Biden sign the Speak Out Act into law earlier this year. The Speak Out Act is bipartisan legislation to prohibit the widespread use of non-disclosure agreements that silence survivors seeking justice. Survivors of sexual assault and harassment deserve the right to report their abuse and I was proud to help get this bill over the finish line and signed into law to ensure that is the reality for survivors across the country. I will continue working in 2023 to ensure survivors of abuse and violence can access the justice they deserve. My bipartisan legislation to help survivors get seperate phone plans from their abusers was signed into law earlier this year. Survivors of domestic violence face enough challenges as they escape their abusers and rebuild their lives - they should not have to worry about their abusers weaponizing and controlling their phone plans. This year, I was proud to get my legislation, the Safe Connections Act , signed into law to provide a clear template for survivors to work with their phone carriers to exit from a shared plan and help them quickly cut ties with their abusers. This legislation will make a real difference for New Hampshire families and survivors. I look forward to seeing this law take effect in 2023 and will continue working to ensure survivors have the tools and support they need to rebuild their lives and recover. Law enforcement officers in New Hampshire and across the country are often on the front lines of mental health and substance use crises. Our police officers and first responders put themselves in harm's way each and every day to protect our communities. We must ensure they have the training and support they need to do their jobs safely. The Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act of 2022, which was signed into law by the president this year, will give police officers and the mental health professionals who work with them the tools to effectively and safely respond to people in crisis. I was proud to support this legislation and will continue fighting for our law enforcement officers. Promoting Health and Wellness for Granite Staters I will continue working to lower health care costs across the board for New Hampshire families. For too long, the pharmaceutical industry has taken advantage of seniors in New Hampshire and across the country. No more. In 2022, Congress took decisive action and passed the Inflation Reduction Act to lower health care costs for New Hampshire seniors - the effects of which will be felt by families across the country. 💰 Finally allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prices 💊 Capping out-of-pocket Rx costs at $2,000 for those on Medicare Part D 👨‍⚕️ Capping out-of-pocket insulin costs to $35/month for those on Medicare 💉 Eliminating vaccine costs for seniors on Medicare Part D Granite State families will start seeing the impact of these changes on January 1, 2023! I'm pleased to continue the work of the Bipartisan Addiction and Mental Health Task Force in the new year. Mental health - just like physical health and well-being - is a major component of wellness and must be treated as such, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the past year, I was proud to lead the Bipartisan Addiction & Mental Health Task Force and work to advance our priorities to save lives in New Hampshire and across the country. From expanding access to evidence-based treatment to supporting community organizations, I will continue working to address the addiction and mental health epidemic. There is no shame in asking for help. The COVID-19 pandemic pulled back the curtain on the urgent need to expand access to safe, reliable mental health support. And, here in New Hampshire, a new resource is available for anyone who needs it. 9-8-8 is the new national number for suicide prevention, mental health, and substance use crises. You can dial or text 9-8-8 to talk to a trained crisis counselor who can give you advice and assistance when you need it. I was proud to support this resource and will continue working to expand access to mental health resources and support in New Hampshire. Protecting Our Personal Freedoms In the past year, we have seen a disturbing attack on women's reproductive freedoms across the country, including at home in New Hampshire. I believe in less government interference in people's personal, private lives - and that includes the decision of when and how to start a family. This year, the Supreme Court overturned the nearly 50-year precedent of Roe v. Wade , eliminating the right to safe, legal abortion for millions of women across the country. In 2022, we took concrete steps to protect women's personal reproductive freedoms across the country. I was proud to support the Women's Health Protection Act of 2021 - legislation to codify the constitutional right to an abortion as established in Roe v. Wade . As we look toward 2023, I will continue working to establish the right to abortion and defend personal privacy across the country. I want to commend my friend Congressman Chris Pappas for his tireless work leading this historic effort. Everyone deserves the freedom to marry who they love and love how they live - regardless of where they build a life. And, in 2022, I was proud to help get the Respect for Marriage Act over the finish line and signed into law to finally make marriage equality the law of the land. Love is love, and in 2023, our neighbors, family, and loved ones will be able to marry who they love without interference from the government. Honoring Our New Hampshire Veterans and Their Families As the daughter of a WWII POW, advocating for our veterans and their families is personal to me. This year, Congress took a long-overdue step forward to deliver for our country's veterans. The Honoring Our PACT Act was signed into law - this bipartisan legislation recognizes military toxic exposure and provides much-needed health benefits to millions of our nation's veterans. I was proud to help get the PACT Act over the finish line in the House to ensure our nation's veterans who were exposed to toxic chemicals while serving can access the health care they need and deserve. In 2023, I will continue fighting for those who have served. This summer, I toured the VA Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in Littleton. We owe our Granite State veterans and their families a tremendous debt of gratitude for their service. This year, I was proud to stand up against recommendations to close this critical veterans health care center and I was grateful for the opportunity to visit the facility and hear updates. The Littleton VA provides crucial care to veterans in our rural communities - it is essential for the well-being of veterans in the North Country this clinic remains open. I am proud to fight for the men and women who served our nation in uniform and ensure they have access to the health care they need and deserve, regardless of where they live.

In 2023, I will continue fighting for our Granite State servicemembers, veterans, and their families.

As we look toward the new year and make plans for 2023, I am committed to bringing your voice to Washington and delivering real results for the Granite State. I will always put New Hampshire families and priorities first. New Hampshire families want Congress to deliver common-sense solutions that work for them. I am proud to be leading the New Democrat Coalition in the next Congress to do just that. It was great to join WMUR-TV 's Adam Sexton earlier this month to talk about our priorities for the new year, protecting New Hampshire's FITN primary, and more: From lowering costs to addressing the addiction and mental health crisis and expanding access to clean, renewable energy and so much more, we have a lot of work to do in the new year. But, I am filled with hope and determination for the challenges to come. One of my most important jobs as your representative is helping Granite Staters. Thank you for trusting me to bring your voice to Congress - please be in touch with my office if there is anything we can do to be of assistance.

55," I hope you had a joyous and safe holiday with family and friends. For those who are first responders ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ December 31, 2022 Dear Fellow Marylanders. I hope you had a joyous and safe holiday with family and friends. For those who are first responders, frontline workers, and all who keep things running 24/7 regardless of holidays, I thank you for your service to our communities. We could not get through this season, or the year, without your dedication and sacrifice. As promised , I have more to share with you about the historic accomplishments of the 117 th Congress. In this email, I focus on many of the achievements that are strengthening our infrastructure, protecting and improving our environmental quality, and helping our beloved Chesapeake Bay. Each of these projects are fiscally responsible investments in Maryland and our nation, creating jobs and providing resources that make our communities more livable today and far into the future. You may not be aware that I have been a member of the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee since I first arrived in the Senate, and this past Congress I had the opportunity to serve as the chair of EPW's Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Therefore, it was natural that I was actively engaged in shaping key pieces of legislation that together constitute an historic commitment to strengthening and upgrading our nation's infrastructure, taking on the challenge of climate change, and advancing equity and environmental justice. Our accomplishments in these areas include the environmental provisions in the landmark Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the Water Resources Development Act. The Inflation Reduction Act includes more than $35.5 billion to combat climate change and address environmental and equity issues through new programs and grants. These investments include, for example, $3 billion for multi-year Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants to finance community-based projects to monitor and prevent air pollution through low and zero-emission technologies and workforce development to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate climate and health risks posed by extreme heat and urban heat islands, and support climate resiliency efforts. The $369 billion in energy security and climate change mitigation initiatives in the IRA is an unprecedented commitment by the federal government to the transition to clean energy. It is expected that IRA will reduce U.S. greenhouse emissions to approximately 40 percent. Without the enactment of the IRA, this figure was only 26 percent. The Environment and Public Works section of the bill contains several accomplishments I have championed, including $250 million for the General Service Administration (GSA) to upgrade federal facilities to high-performance green buildings. The law also includes a historic expansion of a tax program I have led, the Section 179D energy efficient commercial buildings deduction, which provides a tax deduction for energy efficient building investments. Energy efficiency is good business and good policy. This legislation will expand Section 179D - which was made permanent in 2020 under my leadership - to increase the deduction amount, improve its administration, allow more nonprofits to use the deduction, and expand its use to building retrofits. The IRA supports America's farmers and rural communities, with over $20 billion in funds for climate-smart agricultural practices through existing Farm Bill conservation programs, including $6.75 billion for the Regional Conservation Partnership Program and $1 billion for the Natural Resources Conservation Service, to provide financial and technical assistance to producers. Many sustainable practices such as expanding cover crops and riparian buffers that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and help farmers adapt to climate change also improve water quality, including in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. This investment will build on an additional $22.5 million in conservation assistance that the USDA announced for fiscal year 2022 in May 2022 to help farmers boost water quality improvements and conservation in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Our commitment to the Chesapeake Bay is also reflected in the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) , bipartisan legislation generally developed every two years and once again passed this year. I am proud of my role in drafting this legislation as chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee. The WRDA bill establishes new opportunities for small harbors to receive funding for maintenance dredging. This new program is significant for small communities like those on the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries that would not otherwise receive prioritization, and Maryland has had a backlog of channels that have waited years for maintenance. The WRDA 2020 expands the Army Corps of Engineers assistance for environmental infrastructure in Maryland. A new statewide authorization of $100 million for Maryland that I included in the bill will enable communities to pursue upgrades to wastewater, drinking water, and storm water infrastructure with Army Corps expertise and assistance. The WRDA bill also enables new Army Corps projects on shoreline restoration and protection, and increasingly urgent matter under conditions of climate change and extreme weather events. Maryland is identified as a priority area for such projects. The WRDA bill also authorizes a new Army Corps feasibility study for building the resilience of Washington, D.C.'s drinking water supply, which also impacts Maryland residents in the Washington metropolitan area. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act - also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law , signed into law in November 2021- is a historic and long-overdue investment in our infrastructure that is starting to have an impact in Maryland and across the country. This law will upgrade our aging infrastructure while accelerating the transition to clean energy and transportation, advancing environmental justice and climate equity, and building resilience in the Chesapeake Bay watershed region. A major component of the infrastructure law is the reauthorization of federal transportation programs. In this reauthorization, however, we are introducing important new programs and commitments to addressing climate change and equity. The law includes a bold investment of $18 billion to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change. It includes several of my transportation priorities, including the provisions of the Transportation Alternatives Enhancement Act , a program that I worked to establish with former Senator Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) years ago. The TAP directs a set-aside of federal formula funds to priority projects in local communities - projects like sidewalks, bike paths, and safety improvements that make it easier for people to get around their neighborhoods. Additionally, the law authorizes a provision based on legislation I authored with Senator Wicker to establish new pilot programs at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that will award grants to help low-income households pay their drinking water, wastewater, or stormwater bills. The Low-Income Water Customer Assistance Program addresses the access of low-income households to affordable water services. The threat of sea level rise and extreme weather is already a detriment to Maryland's communities and ecosystems, especially along the Chesapeake Bay. With numerous and successful restoration efforts underway, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act authorizes an additional $238 million towards the Chesapeake Bay Program to reduce further reduce nutrient pollution and improve water quality in the surrounding tributaries. Infrastructure projects take time and thoughtful planning to come to fruition. But just one year after President Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act into law, we are beginning to see its potential. The law delivered another great victory for both the Chesapeake Bay and the Port of Baltimore, with $84 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to begin construction of the Mid-Chesapeake Bay Island Ecosystem Restoration Project . Dredged material from the Port of Baltimore will be used to rebuild the fast-disappearing James and Barren islands in Dorchester County, restoring habitats for wildlife and fish, ensuring safe navigation and the flow of commerce at the Port, and shoring up coastal resilience for local communities. This year has been an exciting year in transportation as planning is turning to action. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has been hard at work standing up new programs, reaching out to states and local governments, and awarding grant dollars to move projects forward across various modes of transportation. Over the last year, several Maryland jurisdictions have been very successful in competing for this new funding to bolster our multi-modal transportation systems, expand pedestrian infrastructure, electrify public and school bus fleets and rehabilitate bridges. Through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity/Local and Regional Project Assistance Grants (RAISE) grant program , the New Carroll Station project was awarded $20.5 million , and Penn Station received $6 million to advance progress on redevelopment and renovations. These rail stations are gathering places and points of connection for pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers, and transit passengers who need safe and efficient access to our cities and neighborhoods. This year Prince George's County received a grant of $560,000 from the new Bridge Investment Program to help with the planning for replacing two bridges in poor condition. Local communities have needed more help to advance this kind of planning, which is prerequisite for getting projects built. Maryland will receive at $409 million in formal funding over five years, plus have eligibility for additional competitive grants, so workers can repair or replace the more than 270 bridges statewide that are in poor condition. Local governments across the state received federal support to modify, replace and upgrade, from diesel-gas powered buses and facilities, to low or no-emission vehicles. Prince George's County received $25 million, Montgomery County $14.88 million, and Anne Arundel County with $1.89 million through the Federal Transit Administration's Low and No Emissions program, and Baltimore City is receiving $9.4 million from EPA's Clean School Bus Program . These awards will accelerate the transition to electric and low-zero emission vehicles and reduce air pollution, better protecting current and future generations. Among the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in Maryland's airports statewide, Martin State Airport received $7.1 million - through the Federal Transit Administration's All Stations Accessibility Program - to modernize and upgrade boarding and alighting platforms, ultimately improving accessibility, and reducing risks for daily passengers by becoming ADA compliant. The infrastructure law also provided authorizations of long-term, dedicated federal funding for capital investments in the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, including the $150 million appropriated in the FY 23 omnibus , and it provides an additional $1 billion of investments through the Appalachian Regional Commission for our region. I also worked to secure a lifeline for Baltimore's Red Line, an east-west transit route that should be near completion now , almost ready for its first passengers. We cannot instantly restore the $900 million in federal funds the state had rejected to move forward the project. However, we did guarantee that the Federal Transit Administration will give fair and timely consideration of a replacement project rather than bumping it to the back of the line. Within the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also is a measure that I led a hearing on and helped shepherd through on its way to become law: the Reconnecting Communities Act . Our measure will allow us to tear down the physical barriers to opportunity that had divided Baltimore City and other jurisdictions by race, such as the Franklin-Mulberry Corridor in West Baltimore. The program will fund planning, design, demolition, and reconstruction of street grids, parks, or other infrastructure through $1 billion of dedicated funding so that we can heal communities and create a legacy of connectivity and inclusion. The COVID 19 pandemic had a devastating impact on our economy and so many communities and small businesses across the country. Thankfully, the various important pieces of legislation discussed above are following up on our initial efforts to support the recovery from this downturn. At the start of the Biden administration, the American Rescue Plan , provided vital economic recovery assistance, including $3 billion in investments through the Economic Development Administration. This funding has supported numerous initiatives across Maryland, including tourism infrastructure redevelopment and restoration on Smith Island , Cambridge, and Havre de Grace. It also funded design and engineering for the Annapolis City Dock resilience project to protect the city from floods; nearly $23 million for workforce development in renewable energy through EDA's Good Jobs Challenge ; a study to explore the feasibility of new passenger ferries on the Chesapeake Bay; facility renovation to support workforce development at Hagerstown Community College; and revolving loan funds supporting small and underserved businesses that face obstacles to other sources of capital. Throughout my years serving on Capitol Hill, I cannot recall another as consequential as the 117 th Congress. I am extremely proud of Maryland's congressional delegation and my colleagues for finding ways to get things done, often against long odds and skepticism from pundits. There is more work ahead, but we are moving in the right direction while still protecting precious taxpayer dollars. I also greatly appreciate your support along the way. You have proven beyond any shadow of doubt that by working together, we can do great things. Happy New Year! Ben Cardin Is this email forwarded to you?

Read more about those efforts here. Q&A: New Year's Resolution: Border Security Q: Why are you calling on the Biden administration to make border security its New Year's resolution? Q: How many overdose deaths will it take to get the administration's attention? Quick Links I was proud to recently nominate 32 Iowans to be considered for appointments to the U.S. service academies. These young Iowans who want to enter the academies and serve our country are a remarkable reflection of our state. Their accomplishments, leadership and desire to serve are exceptional and signal continued excellence in the U.S. armed forces. *** Americans are rightly disgusted with the out-of-control spending from Washington these days. We've endured multiple rounds of partisan trillion-dollar spending from the Democrats who control Washington. While many things were included in the government funding package that I do support, the broken process led to a final product that, taken as a whole, is too expensive and contains too many items that should never have been included. For these reasons, I did not support the massive $1.7 trillion government funding package.

58," Year In Review It's hard to believe 2022 is already coming to an end. While this year presented many challenges for families in Eastern Washington - from historic levels of inflation , to skyrocketing gas prices , and surging crime hurting our communities - there was still a lot of good that came from the last 365 days. As the sun sets on the year that was, and with it the 117th Congress , let's take a moment to reflect on some of the great progress we were able to accomplish together . Every day , my team and I work hard to seek excellence on your behalf. Helping you get answers to your questions and hearing your concerns is one of my favorite parts of serving as your representative. Whether it's by listening to the issues most important to you or by helping your family navigate a federal agency , we are here to serve you. Please do not ever hesitate to reach out to us if there is anything I or my team can do to assist you and your family. Contact Us In case you missed it, my D.C. team has a new office . We hope you'll come see us soon at 2188 Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C.! Click here to learn more about scheduling a tour of the Capitol, the White House, the Library of Congress, and more: Learn More I make it a priority to travel all across Eastern Washington , especially coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. And this year, I had a great time doing just that! I was on the road visiting schools, small businesses, police departments, farms, hospitals, Fairchild Air Force Base, the Lower Snake River dams, and so much more . You can take a look at all the great meetings I had over the course of the year, and the entire 117th Congress, here: Where's Cathy? I believe listening is the best way to build trust at a time when so much trust has been broken in our society. In 2022, I held 14 town halls , which included 10 in-person events and 4 telephone town hall events! I also held 10 Coffee with Cathy meetings. Each one was a great opportunity to hear straight from you about the issues most important to you and your family, and I'm grateful to every one of you for making them possible. Whether you're from Colville, Walla Walla, Spokane, or somewhere in between, thank you to all of you who came out to meet with me and make your voice heard. Since President Biden took office, his policies have waged war on American energy , causing energy prices to skyrocket and making us more reliant on China . That's why I introduced the American Energy Independence from Russia Act to flip the switch on American energy production, lower costs for people in Eastern Washington, and restore our energy dominance on the world stage. I won't stop working until we get this done . As a parent , one of my biggest concerns right now is Big Tech and the impact that social media platforms are having on our kids. These companies are exploiting and profiting off of children at the expense of their mental and physical health . I know I'm not alone, which is why I am more determined than ever to rein in Big Tech's power and keep our children safe online . This summer, my colleagues and I made history by advancing the bipartisan, bicameral American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADDPA) through the House Energy and Commerce Committee. It includes the strongest protections to date , puts Americans back in control of their personal information, and ensures Big Tech faces real consequences for harming our kids. As we look ahead to 2023, I am eager to once again work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to finally establish these clear, robust data protections for every American. You can learn more about what the ADDPA would mean for you and your family here: Learn More Our men and women in uniform sacrifice so much to protect our country . While we can never fully repay them for their service, that will never stop me from trying . In August, I was thrilled to bring the 14th Annual Military Family Summit back to Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane! I am incredibly grateful for all the servicemembers and their families that could join us , and I'm especially grateful for my friend and co-chair of the Congressional Military Family Caucus, Congressman Sanford D. Bishop Jr. , for continuing to host with me after all these years. Watch a recap of this year's successful event below: Watch Now I've made it my mission to take what I've learned at the MFS Summit back with me to Congress, and it yielded great results this year. For example, in the annual defense spending bill , I helped secure a 4.6% pay increase for our troops - including those at Fairchild Air Force Base! This bill also finally rescinded President Biden's misguided COVID-19 vaccine mandate on active-duty and reserve members of our military. You can learn more about the huge wins in this legislation here: Wins for Servicemembers 2022 was also another important year for demanding accountability from the VA. It's no secret that the VA has broken my trust many times over the years. But when it was revealed that 149 veterans have been harmed by the electronic health record (EHR) system, I was outraged . I was quick to call them out for their lack of transparency and devastating mistakes . In a July House Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing, I confronted VA leadership face to face . Watch below: Watch Now There's still more work to be done for our veterans, and that work will never stop . Click here for a full look at what we accomplished for veterans in Eastern Washington: Learn More Whenever I'm back home in Eastern Washington, I always love taking the opportunity to recognize some of America's heroes who live right here in our communities. In case you missed it, here are a few of the incredible veterans I had the honor of presenting medals to this year! U.S. Army Specialist Dennis McDonald from Clarkston received the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, and the Air Medal for his service in Vietnam. U.S. Army Sergeant Michael Schwartz from Colville received the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, and Commendation Medals for Heroism and Valor for his service in Vietnam. Joann Boucher received the Silver Star and Purple Heart on behalf of her late husband, U.S. Army Sergeant Arthur F. Boucher , for his service in Vietnam. SSG Luis Barragan and SSG Robert Wadleigh received the Army Achievement Medal for outstanding achievement and meritorious service at the Army National Guard Readiness Center in Spokane Valley. The fight also continued this year to protect the Lower Snake River dams - the beating heart of Eastern Washington - from the policies of Governor Jay Inslee, Senator Patty Murray, and President Biden . On multiple occasions, they issued a series of proposals advocating for the breaching of the dams, without hearing the opinions of those in our region who would feel the devastating impacts the most. I have been demanding transparency and accountability from the Biden administration on this. I even toured the Lower Granite Dam this summer to discuss how these dams are critical for irrigation and navigation , and the millions of megawatts of hydropower they provide are irreplaceable. Rest assured that I will go into 2023 continuing the fight to protect the dams - and the benefits they provide - at all costs. ﻿Our farmers are the backbone of our community, and I will do whatever it takes to advocate for their needs. With Congress getting ready to work on the Farm Bill in 2023, I would like to know: If you are a farmer or rancher in Eastern Washington, what would you like to see included in the Farm Bill? Submit a response below! Submit A Response My priorities for the farm bill this year will be protecting crop insurance , supporting market access programs , and investing in research like the great work being done at WSU - but that's just the start. I will be looking to build on our progress to prevent the Chinese Communist Party from purchasing farmland in the United States. For those who may have missed it, I took action this year by joining Rep. Dan Newhouse (WA-04) in introducing the Prohibition of Agricultural Land for the People's Republic of China Act to stop this from happening, support domestic food production, and decrease our dependence on foreign adversaries. You can learn more about my work for farmers and ranchers here: Learn More For the better part of two years, fear and isolation have contributed to a worsening mental health crisis in Eastern Washington. Families are in despair . Our kids feel broken and alone . But this year, we took one step closer to delivering hope and healing to our communities. By a vote of 402-20 , the House of Representatives passed my bipartisan Restoring Hope and Mental Health and Well-being Act to reverse the devastating mental health crisis made worse by government driven lockdowns. This bill was later signed into law by President Biden, and my hope is that it will build a brighter future for all. I also led the effort to ensure our seniors - particularly those living in rural areas - can access telehealth services through Medicare if they choose to do so. We've learned through the pandemic that giving patients the option to see a doctor virtually can remove hurdles , like transportation burdens, missed work, or limited mobility. The effort I led, which received more than 400 votes in the House, was signed into law. Finally, I was proud to help pass legislation that would help rural hospitals to purchase mobile health units and expand their reach to patients in hard to reach places . You can learn more about this bill and all of my work to expand health care access here: Learn More One of the most devastating challenges we faced this year was the surge in violent crime . Homicides and assaults were on the rise across the country, and it's horrifying . Watch Now But I've been working hard to restore law and order and bring safety back to our communities. I've been leading the charge to pass the HALT Fentanyl Act , which would permanently schedule fentanyl analogues and give police the resources they need to get these deadly drugs off our streets . Democrats have blocked this legislation 7 times. Unfortunately, Spokane was labeled a crisis spot for fentanyl , so there is no more time to delay a permanent solution. Earlier this year, I hosted a roundtable to hear from community leaders, law enforcement, and the loved ones of those lost to fentanyl poisoning to share their stories and to have a discussion about this legislation and other ways the community can work together to end this devastating crisis. I have also been working on a number of other ways to keep our communities safe, including: The Sex Trafficking Demand Reduction Act to combat sex trafficking around the world. Legislation to establish a National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls . The Safe to Tell Act to detect and prevent violence in our school systems.

60," Rep. Troy E. Nehls' Military Sexual Trauma Legislation Signed Into Law Dear  , Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year! I wanted to take a moment to share with you a recap on what happened this week in Texas' 22nd District and the United States House of Representatives. This Week in Washington Rep. Troy E. Nehls' Military Sexual Trauma Legislation Signed Into Law This week, legislation that I authored was signed into law after passing the Senate by Unanimous Consent last week. H.R. 6064 will improve the VA's Military Sexual Trauma (MST) disability exam process by requiring the V.A. to partner with the National Academies to complete a comprehensive review of the process. The bill would also require the VA to provide the House Veterans Affairs Committee and the Senate Veteran Affairs Committee with a report on any actions they plan to take as a result of findings and recommendations in the NASEM study. I am proud that my bill has received broad bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress and has been signed into law.

61," At Long Last My Last Long's Short Report December 30, 2022 At Long Last My Last Long's Short Report Let's start at the beginning. The beginning in this case was when my wife Barbara and I stepped off the members-elect bus on the plaza where you enter our nation's beautiful Capitol building in Washington, DC. It was a dark and stormy night, the wind was howling through the... no not really but it was dark that November night in 2010. As we stepped off the bus at the base of the Capitol directly under the dome and looked up at Old Glory waving and at the sight of that magnificent dome lit up from every angle, I was left utterly speechless and overcome by emotion. Speechless that is other than muttering to my wife ""Look at that!"" From there we were ushered inside to an astonishing array of murals, frescos, marble floors and right into Statuary Hall where soon to be Speaker of the House John Boehner was to host a fancy dinner with cloth table clothes for all incoming freshmen Republicans and their spouses. Speaker of the House of Representatives is a thankless job I would not wish on my worst enemy but Speaker Boehner and his wife Debbie became dear friends to Barbara and me. During my freshman term the Washingtonian Magazine did a 'Best and Worst' analysis of several different categories. The nicest person in Congress that year went to one of my best friends on Capitol Hill, Representative Brett Guthrie of Kentucky which surprised no one. However the top two finishers in ""The funniest person in Congress"" surprised everyone. The funniest person award went to the afore mentioned Speaker Boehner and finishing a close second was yours truly. I was a 55 year old freshman Congressman with no political experience - you see I had never run for any elected office before because I was always afraid that I might get elected! They say we need to elect normal everyday people off the street to go to Washington and serve in Congress and not career politicians. Well that year we had done it on steroids. Two auctioneers, two car dealers, farmers, the owner of a pest control company, a pizza parlor owner, a roofing contractor, lawyers, doctors, nurses, radio personalities, members of the military, veterans and small business owners. We had it all, just like Bogey and McCall. Outgoing Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi hosted a reception in the conference room adjacent to her office and had invited all members-elect to attend. I don't remember any other Republican members-elect joining besides myself and Barbara because the Speaker was a Democrat of all things. When we met Madam Speaker herself I asked if we could take a picture with her and she immediately obliged. I handed my iPhone to someone who took the picture which I immediately texted to a reporter at our local paper in Springfield, Missouri who printed it the next day. Man 'o man did that set off a firestorm, one comment I remember was ""can you believe how dumb Long is, he let someone take a picture of him and Pelosi together."" My thought was 'yeah, I'm so dumb I asked for it to be taken on my personal iPhone and texted it to a reporter at my local paper.' Many speculated that such an unforced rookie error would definitely end my tenure in Congress after only one term. It turned out that photo wasn't such a dumb move after all. as I was elected to Congress five more times after that,. I came to Congress after a 32 year career as a real estate broker, 31 years as an auctioneer and 6 years as a radio talk show host. To be successful in those fields you have to be U.F.O. as I call it, Upbeat, Friendly and Open. As I reflect on the end of a 12 year career in Congress I probably have as many friends on the Democrat side of the aisle as I do the Republican side. I have one of the most conservative voting records of anyone in Congress so I don't hardly ever vote the same as my Democrat friends but just because we don't agree politically doesn't mean we can't be friends personally. I am proud of what I was able to accomplish in Washington such as working to protect Table Rock Lake homeowners from bureaucratic red tape and unnecessary restrictions, helping provide financing for American manufacturers to sell their products to international buyers, working across the aisle with my friend Congresswoman Doris Matsui to reauthorize the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act, preventing harassing robocalls, strengthening broadband internet access to close the digital divide in rural and underserved areas, working with my colleague Congressman Emanuel Cleaver from Missouri on suicide prevention, combatting our nation's opioid epidemic, modernizing our nation's energy infrastructure for the 21st century, ensuring children get the care they need by closing the treatment gap for newborns, keeping in place protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions, stopping the military vaccine mandate, strengthening bilateral ties with Japan in my seven years as Co-Chair of the Congressional Study Group on Japan, supporting the important H-2B visa seasonal worker program that is so critical to small business' in my district, and most recently expanding the boundaries of Wilson's Creek National Battlefield to include acres that are relevant to the Newtonia Battlefield site. But I'm really proud of what I accomplished for my constituents back home in the district. With my work on the subcommittee on Telecommunications when I learned how inaccurate our broadband maps were which rendered them useless, I went to work on a mapping bill to correct the situation. I did not work alone as I needed a partner on the Democrat side of the aisle to help me. There was only one man for the job - one A. Donald McEachin the Democrat Congressman from Virginia's 4th Congressional District. Don and I got 'er done and our bill was eventually signed into law by President Trump. It's times like this that it's good to have friends to work with across the aisle. Speaking of bipartisanship earlier this month on December 7th I did something else in a bipartisan fashion. What I did was to join some of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle at Joint Base Andrews for a flight to Richmond, Virginia to attend Don's 2 hour and 40 minute funeral although it seemed like it lasted only 40 minutes. It was an incredible service. He was taken too soon but I was sure glad we had been able to get to know each other by working on our broadband mapping bill together. Another thing I don't like about Congress is that when you first get elected you're told never to talk about your staff, don't mention them or praise them. When I queried ""What do you mean, why would that be?"" I was told ""You want the people back home to think you're doing all the work - don't ever mention your staff."" That may not be the dumbest thing I've ever heard but it ranks right up there in the top two or three. When I first ran for Congress I was attacked for having no political experience - 'Long knows nothing about politics, he has no experience and won't even know how to hire staff'. My reply was ""There's enough experience in Washington, DC to choke a horse,"" and if you were with my auction company 20 years or less you were one of the newer people there. You see it's like Teddy Roosevelt said, ""I always hired good people and had the sense to stay out of their way and let them do their job."" You always run the risk of leaving someone out when you go to naming names but I've narrowed my list of Missouri District 7 All-Stars to two categories. The first is the dedicated folks that were with me on the third day of January 2011 and will be with me until high noon on January 3, 2023. The second is a group that didn't start the race with me but will be with me in their official capacity serving the Constituents of Missouri's 7th Congressional District until noon on January 3, 2023. The longest tenured on a personal basis with me is my Director of Farm Services Bob Kollmeier, you see Bob and I have been together since the sixth grade when we met and he has been working in my District Office helping local farmers since I came into Congress. Next to Bob in time of service to me is my District Scheduler one Karen Meads. Karen joined me in the auction business and then in the Congressional office, in total she has worked for me for over 32 years. Then there is my Chief of Staff Joe Lillis who will retire from federal service after 27 years, four serving in the US Army and 23 on the Hill, he has worked for a United States Senator, and three Congressmen including myself. That brings us to Mike Ussery my District Director back home. Mike also started with me on January 3, 2011 and plays the part of me when I'm not home by representing me at any meeting he could attend in the district and has done an outstanding job of it. Mike's not going far but he is moving across town to go to work for U.S. Senator-elect Eric Schmitt. Last but not least is our longest serving staffer in the 7th District who boasts 16 years of service because she worked for then Congressman Roy Blunt for 4 years before starting with me on the day I started and she just won't leave. You'll still be able to find Kim Mackney behind her desk in our Joplin office working for my successor Congressman-elect Eric Burlison beginning January 3, 2023. Now for those that didn't start in 2011 but have vowed to stay by my side until they change the locks on our doors. Batting leadoff is Ben Elleson who is fairly new in my office, as he's only been with me for 11 of my 12 years. I've heard it numerous times over the years, Ben Elleson is the best staffer on the hill and I won't disagree. I believe their thinking is it that takes a lot to make me look good and Ben does it every time without fail. Next up is Jeremy Pruett who's been a huge asset handling any issue or problem that is given to him. Hitting third is Lisa Saylor who all of the veterans in our district think hung the moon. She's my veterans specialist but she's more of a magician than anything when it comes to getting veterans their just desserts. Luckily for the veterans of Missouri's 7th District, Lisa will also be staying on with Congressman-elect Burlison. Batting clean-up is Sydney Ingram Johnson who handles a myriad of constituent issues including assisting Lisa with our hero veterans and helping out with our annual 'Fishing Dreams' event for veterans. Next to step to the plate is Dylan Maddox who not only handles legislative issues but also makes sure the trains or in my case Suburbans run on time. Next we have my Communications Director Michael Appelbaum whose middle name is 'Loyal' he has been with me since 2017. Then we have Gwen Delano, who has worked in my Joplin office since 2019, after working in the Missouri State Legislature since 1984. Rounding out our stellar All-Star lineup is our DC scheduler Sean Manzelli who needed to be a world class juggler to handle all of the requests for my time. I hope all of the remaining Congressmen are blessed with staffs half as talented and dedicated as mine has been. And finally I'd like to say a few words about my family. Being a Congressman is tough but being the family of a Congressman is a lot tougher. It ain't easy and they didn't sign up for it. You could not ask for a more ideal Congressional spouse than my wife Barbara. If you ever want to find her at an event look in one of the four corners of the room. You see she always wants to make sure others are served first but she's ready to jump in and help out at a moment's notice. She just plugs in and helps out wherever needed. Everyone asks where we met and the answer is at the E. Tolerton School of Dance in Cheyenne, Wyoming she in her tutu and me in my four-four. Our oldest daughter Kaleen made it to DC before I did as she completed a two year post baccalaureate Pre-Med program at Georgetown and left town six months before I was sworn in. And when our youngest Kelle called one year after graduating from Pepperdine to say she had been offered a job at NBC in Tenleytown outside of DC I said come on out! Kelle's husband Dan joined our family a few years ago. Next in time of service with the family is 'Tex' the toy poodle or 'Sir Texcellent' as I call him. And last but certainly not least is one Walker Bill Rathe who turned one month old yesterday making him the most junior member of our family. Everyone asks what my title will be once I leave Congress and thanks to Walker for the first time you can call me Grandpa Long. Grandpa out!

62," Click here to view this email in your browser Dear Dr.  , Happy New Year! 2022 has been a productive year for me and my team on behalf of eastern Connecticut. From helping constituents settle nearly 1000 issues with federal agencies, to working side-by-side with our towns to kick-start important projects, to securing new support for our manufacturing workforce and for the U.S. Navy, it's been an honor to serve the Second District. As the year closes, I'm here with a rundown of just some of our biggest wins for CT-02 in 2022. Have a happy and safe weekend, and a great start to 2023. A Year's Worth of Work for Eastern CT My Norwich and Enfield offices work with people in our region every day to help with issues regarding federal agencies-from VA services, to Social Security, to federal grants, and lots more. Some of our most important cases involve returning money owed by the federal government to constituents here in eastern CT. This year, my team recovered over $53 million for people in CT-02. That alone represents more than 960 total successful cases for local individuals and small businesses, and we're ready to keep the work going. If you need help working with a federal agency, give us a call or visit my website . Norwich office: (860) 886-0139 Enfield office: (860) 741-6011 Kick-Starting Important New Community Projects When Congress passed the 2022 budget back in March, it was the first time that ""Community Project Funding"" was included-opportunities for funding directed straight to communities across the U.S., targeted at completing important local projects. I worked side-by-side with our towns and community partners to secure federal funding for 10 Community Projects in 2022 - part of $29 million in total Community Project Funding that we brought home for eastern CT in the 2022 budget. These 10 projects included new career training opportunities for students at Groton Public Schools, expanded services at Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam, renovations at the historic Town Hall building in Scotland, and lots more. For a full list of my 2022 Community Projects, click here , and click here to check out the 2022 Community Projects Map. Click here to watch Rep. Courtney explain his 2022 Community Projects One of my 2022 Community Projects was $2.5 million for site preparation at the future Enfield Train Station. We secured that funding in March, and just a few months later I was excited to announce that more than a decade of work, full funding had finally been awarded for construction of the new station. Enfield and surrounding communities have been without a train station for more than 35 years, but now that's about to change. The Enfield Train Station will be a new stop of the successful CTrail Hartford Line, and will be located in the Thompsonville section of Enfield-at nearly the same site as the popular old station. The return of rail service is long overdue, and my team and I worked alongside the Town of Enfield, Governor Lamont, CTDOT, and local leaders like State Rep. Tom Arnone for over 10 years to make this transformative project a reality. With federal funding now in place, construction is projected to begin in 2024. Click here for more specifics about the project. Click here to watch Rep. Courtney provide a breakdown of the Enfield Train Station project These 10 projects were part of the 2022 budget, and we've already seen them begin to have a positive impact here in our region. My team and I kept the work going strong for next year, and just last week Congress voted to pass the 2023 budget-this time, it includes my funding requests for 15 new Community Projects in eastern Connecticut. We worked in tandem with community leaders once again this year to request funding for efforts that would be most impactful for our towns, and I'm looking forward to checking in on these projects in 2023. Click here to learn more about Rep. Courtney's 2023 Community Projects New Support for Eastern CT Veterans Supporting the men and women who wore our nation's uniform has always been one of my top priorities as eastern Connecticut's representative in Congress. We've got more veterans in eastern Connecticut than any other part of the state, I meet with them regularly at Veterans Coffeehouses and other events in every corner of our region, and this year there were two big wins that really stuck out for our veterans: passage of the Honoring Our PACT Act, and the long-awaited opening of the new Veterans Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in New London. The House passed the PACT Act on a bipartisan basis, it was signed into law in August, and it's making sure millions of veterans who were exposed to toxins during service can finally get treatment for illnesses they developed later in life. Since the bill was signed into law, more than 185,000 Veterans have applied for PACT Act-related benefits , and more than 730,000 have received toxic exposure screenings made possible by the law , with nearly 39% reporting a concern of exposure. There's still more work to do to make sure that every Veteran, their families, and their caregivers are aware of these new reforms, and if you have any questions, please feel free to call my Norwich Office, and to ask for my Veterans Casework Representative Manny Meneses (USN Ret.). We've talked a lot over the past few years about the effort to create a new, larger VA clinic to serve our veteran community. Now it's officially here-in April, we celebrated the opening of the VA's new John J. McGuirk New London CBOC. It took years to get this over the finish line. We went through multiple rounds of surveys and site visits with the VA to prove we needed the investment, and in 2020 we finally announced the lease award for the new CBOC. I checked-in on construction regularly after that with our Veterans' Caseworker Manny Meneses (USN Ret.) and CT VA Director Al Montoya to make sure things stayed on track during the pandemic, the team did a great job, and now the brand-new New London CBOC is officially open. It's 3x the size of the old one, with more staff, more services, shorter wait times, and top-flight facilities. This was a great win for our local veterans. The effort to secure top-flight care for eastern CT vets dates to the mid-90s, when vets like John McGuirk, a WWII Navy Hardhat Diver, helped establish the first clinic at the Coast Guard Academy. Federal Grants Fueling Local Priorities My office in Norwich closely tracks federal grant opportunities for important work in eastern Connecticut-for our schools and small businesses, for workforce development efforts, to support our first responders, and lots more. In 2022, the Second District earned over 950 grants and subgrants , totaling nearly $2 billion in federal funding . My team and I work closely with many people and groups who are applying for federal support to make their projects a reality, and in Congress I help advocate for their projects and work to keep important grant programs fully funded. Take a look at just a few highlights from the federal grant funding that came into the Second District this year: These federal grants are often highly competitive, and the process of applying for them is hard work. Some of the grants awarded in 2022 came after years of persistence and re-applications. My team and I are here to work with eastern Connecticut applicants every step of the way, and you can learn more about federal grant opportunities available to groups in eastern Connecticut here. Support for First Responders Our first responders do heroic and often dangerous work to keep us safe. One of my top priorities in Congress is making sure they have the support needed to do their jobs safely and effectively. In 2022, we secured some big wins for eastern Connecticut firefighters, police officers, and other first responders-check out a few highlights below: Assistance to Firefighters and Port Security grants are really invaluable - both for the safety of our communities, and for those who protect us. With these resources, fire stations in eastern Connecticut are making much-needed upgrades to their equipment, like new uniforms, air packs, and hydraulic rescue equipment. On the heels of newly enhanced benefits for firefighters and police officers through the Protecting America's First Responders Act- which was signed into law last year , and includes my bipartisan Fire Police Fairness Act-these AFG awards represent another important source of federal support for our firefighters. Thank you to the stations who welcomed me for visits in 2022 and updated me on how they'll use these grants! We've also taken more steps this year to keep expanding benefits for first responders and their families. For example, the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act ensures - for the first time - that federal firefighters will receive care for cancer-related illnesses they contracted through toxic-exposure while serving our communities. At SUBASE New London, we host lots of federal firefighters who risk their lives to protect people in eastern Connecticut. With this initial list of presumed 'work-related' conditions, these firefighters and others across the country will now have a clear path to receiving the care they deserve. The Infrastructure Law Gets Off the Ground Just over a year ago, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law. In 2022, it helped kick off, continue, and complete work in projects across the Second District. As we close the year, the IIJA is supporting over 90 projects to the tune of over $800 million in federal funding. Thanks to this once-in-a-generation infrastructure investment, our towns have been able to take on these projects at no cost to their budgets. Take a look at some of the largest projects in eastern Connecticut. IIJA funding will be providing a boost to Connecticut for the next four years, and I've been checking in with officials in towns throughout eastern CT to help make sure it's being delivered efficiently and that local priorities are being met. I'm happy to say that we've gotten off to a strong start, and I'm excited to continue helping our communities get the job done. In August, Rep. Courtney hosted U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh (left) for a visit to the Gold Star Bridge in New London, where the IIJA is funding repairs to the northbound span. From upgrades to our 3 regional airports, to the completion of dredging in the Patchogue River, to the construction of a new port in New London, repairs to the Leonard Road Bridge in Stafford, and lots of other smaller projects, the IIJA is fueling work throughout CT-02 Legislative Highlights for Eastern Connecticut 2022 saw lots of other important work get done for eastern Connecticut-from important investments in workforce development programs, efforts to lower energy and health care costs, support for our U.S. Navy, and lots more. Here are just a few other highlights from a highly productive year: This is our last newsletter of 2022, and of the 117th Congress. It's an honor to serve you in Washington, and I am grateful for the chance to do so again in 2023 and in the 118th Congress. Bipartisanship has always been my approach, it's helped us get some important work done for eastern Connecticut, and I'll continued working across the aisle to get our region's priorities across the finish line.

63," CONTACT ME SIGN UP FOR MY NEWSLETTER HELP WITH FEDERAL AGENCY FLAG REQUEST VISIT WASHINGTON Dear Friend, Although we have faced challenges both old and new this year, there is still much to be grateful for and celebrate. If there is one thing that our community in Northeast Ohio knows how to do, it is how to take care of one another. In the new year, I am confident that we will continue to rebuild from the pandemic and combat rising kitchen table costs. You can count on me to always defend your interests in the halls of Congress. Last month marked one year since I was sworn in to serve as your representative in Congress, and I've never stopped fighting for our district. Highlights from my time in the 117th Congress can be viewed below. The largest climate initiative ever became a reality when President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law in August. The IRA will provide billions in funding to accelerate our transition to a clean energy economy, cap our seniors' drug prices at $2,000 a year, and empower Medicare to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs like insulin - all while strengthening domestic manufacturing. Together with the IRA, the CHIPS and Science Act has helped our manufacturing sector recover more jobs than all those lost during the pandemic recession. My vote helped pass this legislation to strengthen our economy and national security, and spur America's leadership in scientific research and technological innovation. In addition to voting for these bills, I've introduced legislation to support patients with mental and physical health comorbidities, improve the outcomes of federal programs that serve the public, and expand the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) so it is more inclusive. In summary, I've cosponsored or introduced 199 bills so far this year to protect our people and promote our community's most precious values. This time of year, I always reflect on the gift of my family and friends. In these final days of 2022, let me wish you and your family a healthy and blessed holiday season, and prosperity and peace in the new year! It is an honor to represent you in 2022, and I look forward to lifting your voices in 2023. Sincerely, Shontel Brown Member of Congress WASHINGTON D.C.

64," App Challenge winners announced Email not displaying correctly? Click here. This week in Congress December 30, 2022 2022 - The Year in Review App Challenge winners announced $1.6m for vaccination support Free COVID tests again available $98k for juvenile justice aid Bring back Japan tourism Welcome, Park family Tinian office moves KILILI TIME CAPSULE OPPORTUNITIES HIGHLIGHTS The 117th House of Representatives gathered for our official photograph before concluding work last week. Below, your congressional office recalls some highlights of this momentous year. January Free COVID tests As the Marianas struggled with a surge in COVID, the Biden administration made a half-billion free tests available for American households to order online for home delivery . Initially, the system would not recognize Marianas addresses because we use post office boxes, but your congressional office quickly got the problem fixed . February Focusing on Medicaid The annual Interagency Group on Insular Areas meeting was an opportunity for me to remind the Biden administration of the work needed on Medicaid. Congress addressed the funding problem with a large and permanent increase ($64 million for the Marianas this year) and automatic inflation adjustments in Public Law 116-94 . But the favorable federal/local matching rate in that law (83/17) was only temporary and would revert to 55/45 on September 30. The President listened. When he released his budget proposal in May, he recommended aligning our rates with states' . March Marianas community projects: $4.5m For the first time since 2010, when the Republican majority blocked Members of Congress from directing funds to hometown needs, I was able to secure earmarks for Marianas organizations that provide vital public services. The Democratic majority restarted community project funding; and the fiscal 2022 appropriation, signed into law in March, included $4.5 million for Northern Marianas College, the Public School System, Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation, Karidat, and the Judicial branch . April New help for Veterans' caregivers Marianas families caring for a disabled veteran became eligible for help -including a monthly stipend-from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Your congressional office took action when veterans reported their applications for the caregivers program were being rejected. The Department was telling veterans our islands are not part of the United States! As a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, I immediately let the Department know they were wrong and injuring men and women who had put their lives on the line for America. The Department apologized to those rejected and the program is now in operation. May Head Start sign up eased Enrolling their young children in Head Start got easier for Marianas families receiving Nutrition Assistance Program food aid. Your congressional office worked with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which administers Head Start, to confirm that the ""categorical eligibility"" for the children of families that participate in the national Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, will also apply to Marianas families in our Nutrition Assistance Program, NAP. Categorical eligibility means less paperwork for families to qualify their children for Head Start. $52m for Marianas infrastructure. We made sure the Marianas was included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law ; and six months later, the White House informed us, $51.6 million had been awarded. ($62.3 million as of October 25.) Included was $21 million for the Kagman Watershed Project and airport improvement money for Saipan, Tinian, and Rota. June Marianas flag flies at Smithsonian museum The flag of the Northern Mariana Islands was raised for the first time at the National Museum of American History on June 14, Flag Day. I initiated the request for inclusion of all insular area flags alongside those of the states; and Dr. Anthea M. Hartig, the Museum's Director, responded positively. For 60 years, this display has been incomplete, she said during the ceremony. Now we are acting ""to right that wrong."" July $10,000 prize for Marianas teachers One science or math teacher from the Marianas will be selected each year for a Presidential Award for Excellence under provisions of my STEM Educator Awards Equity Act . I piggybacked my bill onto the CHIPS and Science Act, Public Law 117-167 , which Congress sent to the President in July. The selected Marianas teacher will receive $10,000 from the National Science Foundation and will participate in expert-led training and collaboration opportunities in Washington. Previously, Marianas teachers had to compete with teachers from American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands for the annual prize. August Marianas veterans got to speak directly with Veterans Affairs Deputy Secretary Donald Remy , the number two official at the Department in August. As a member of the House Committee on Vet﻿erans Affairs, I invited Remy to survey the state of available VA services in the Marianas and continue working with me to improve aid to veterans. Biden signs PACT Act The 3.5 million veterans, including those in the Marianas, exposed to deadly toxins in the line of duty will have automatic access to life-saving care under terms of the Honoring our PACT Act , a major achievement of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs in this Congress. The Department of Veterans Affairs now honors claims for 23 new conditions and cancers identified in the law and presumed to result from exposure to burn pits and other hazardous conditions. September Marianas voter assist is now law Marianas voters with limited mobility or other barriers to casting their ballot will be helped by U.S. Public Law 117-182, the Protection and Advocacy for Voting Access Program Inclusion Act . The new law adds the Marianas to entities eligible for grants to train poll workers, maintain voting hotlines, and assure polling places are accessible to all. I introduced the legislation, H.R. 7326 , in the House with Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Arizona). October Congressional Delegation in Tinian A CODEL led by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Florida) Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, along with Rep. Ed Case (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa), visited Tinian in October. They toured the Air Force divert airfield, North Field, and the Tinian harbor along with Joint Region Marianas Commander Rear Adm. Benjamin Nicholson and Tinian leadership. The Subcommittee appropriated $191 million for Tinian in the fiscal 2023 appropriations law. November $6.3m to continue student meals More than 13,000 NMI children who lack regular access to meals at their schools or child care centers will continue to receive free breakfasts, lunches, and snacks through the Pandemic EBT program. Congress provided P-EBT for Marianas students in a continuing resolution in October 2020 ; and your congressional office has been encouraging the Public School System, the Commonwealth government, and the U.S Department of Agriculture to extend the program through 2023. December NDAA passes, Marianas benefits In addition to increasing pay and benefits for service members, authorizing $191 million for divert field projects on Tinian, and reauthorizing the Coral Reef Conservation Act, this year's defense bill contained my legislation creating an advisory board within the Department of Veterans Affairs with representatives from the Marianas and each of the other U.S. insular areas. The National Defense Authorization Act also includes my Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act , addressing the sharp decline in shark populations worldwide by banning the commercial trade in shark fins within the United States. This ban mirrors Marianas law and several U.S. states' prohibitions on sale, purchase, or possession of shark fins. Fiscal 2023 Appropriations Act signed President Biden signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act with funding for the federal government for all of fiscal year 2023. The Marianas fared well: Permanent Medicaid FMAP in 2023 spending law. A year that began with a focus on Medicaid, ended with a final solution to a long-standing inequity in how the Marianas and other insular areas are treated versus states. The Marianas' statutory federal share of Medicaid, 55 percent, is now permanently raised to 83 percent , better than the FMAP for any state . Without this change the Commonwealth would have faced $40 million in costs this year to access all the available Medicaid funding made possible by U.S. Public Law 116-94 . $26.8m for congressional projects . The Commonwealth's Department of Public Works, Office of Transit Authority, the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation, Joeten-Kiyu Public Library, Northern Marianas College, the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation, and the Public School System will all receive funding for their community projects that I requested be added to the fiscal 2023 appropriation act. The fourteen Marianas projects are worth $26,838,182. More nutrition assistance . Marianas families and individuals enrolled in the Nutrition Assistance Program will benefit from the $34 million in food aid -$4 million more than last year-that I secured for NAP in the fiscal 2023 appropriation. This is $24 million more than when I first entered Congress and began working to achieve Marianas parity with the states in federal food aid. More funds for drinkable water . For the fourteenth year the set-aside of 1.5 percent for the Marianas and other insular areas from Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act funds continues. I was first able to raise the set-aside in the 2010 appropriation, though statutorily we are only authorized for 0.25 percent and 0.33 percent, respectively, from the two laws. The annual formula tweak has resulted in $86 million extra for the Marianas and brought 24-hour water to almost every household. Our next target: drinkable water. School aid, Pell grant up. Funding for the Marianas Public School System from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act will go up an estimated $630,000 from the current $13,018,246. As Chair of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education, I led the request signed by 107 other Members of Congress asking to increase ESEA Title I grants. And 1,724 Marianas college students will see as much as a $500 bump in their annual Pell grant for tuition and supplies. The maximum grant will now be $7,395 . $15.5m to cut electric costs. Funding for the Energizing Insular Communities program increases more than 40 percent, from $11 million to $15.5 million, in fiscal 2023; and insular technical assistance grants increase to $22.3 million. Both programs are funded at the level I requested . Energizing Insular Communities is intended to lower electricity costs by moving us away from costly-and dirty-imported fossil fuels to cheaper, cleaner domestic sources of energy, such as solar and wind. Marianas a ""state"" for election grants. The fiscal 2023 appropriation includes $75,000,000 for the federal Election Commission to make payments to ""states"" for improvements to election management and security-and the Marianas is deemed a state for purposes of this funding. With trust in elections under constant assault in our nation, I want to ensure robust support for Commonwealth officials who are responsible for keeping our votes safe and vote counting reliable. Congratulations to Carson Lin, James Lin, Dip Roy, and Jaehoon Son, winners of this year's Congressional App Challenge. Their winning app MathPal is web-based and designed to help high school students understand mathematical concepts. The team of four will receive national recognition and have their work eligible for display in the U.S. Capitol. They will also be invited to attend the House of Code reception in Washington, D.C. The Congressional App Challenge is an annual competition open to middle and high school students. Next year's App Challenge will commence in late summer 2023. $1.6m for vaccination support As part of the continuing support from Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation was awarded $1,601,945.28 on Tuesday. The funds, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, are directed specifically at the Commonwealth's vaccination program. No match from the Commonwealth government is required. Congratulations to CHCC. Free COVID tests again available In anticipation of a resurgence of COVID-19 as families and friends gather for the holiday season, the federal government is again providing free, at-home COVID tests to American households. When first offered earlier this year, the website for the free tests had trouble recognizing the post office box addresses most people in the Marianas use. Your congressional office worked to correct those problems; and our constituents did receive the free tests in the mail. This time around the website seems to be accepting post office box addresses in the Marianas without issue. But, please, let your congressional office know, if you do have a problem. To apply for the free tests, up to four per household, go to online or call 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489). $98k for juvenile justice aid Congratulations to the Criminal Justice Planning Agency on the award of a grant of $98,417 on Tuesday to help improve the Commonwealth's juvenile justice program. This is the second year of a three-year formula grant focused on helping develop ""more effective education, training, research, prevention, diversion, treatment, and rehabilitation programs in the area of juvenile delinquency as well as juvenile justice system improvement efforts."" The funds support the work of the Office of Youth Affairs, the Department of Public Safety, the Commonwealth Judiciary, the Department of Corrections, the Attorney General, and the Office of the Public Defender. The funds also underwrite the Juvenile Justice Specialist position at the Criminal Justice Planning Agency. Congratulations, CJPA. Bring back Japan tourism. This week I met with Mr. Mike Imai and Mr. Ikou, both long-time residents of Saipan. We discussed crucial small steps the Commonwealth can take to bring back tourism from Japan. Thank you, gentlemen, for sharing your ideas. Welcome, Park Family. Air Force Capt. Sun (Alex)(Right), Army 1st Lieutenant Moon (Richard)(Left) and their father Byung Hoon Park dropped by their congressional office for a family holiday visit. The Park brothers both in active duty are home visiting family and friends this week. Alex was one of my military academy nominees. Happy New Year! 1 Year Ago COVID funeral aid available Funeral cost assistance is available for Marianas families who lose a loved one from COVID-19. Congress provided this aid in the 2021 Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act . As of December 6, the program has helped in the Marianas with $10,894, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which distributes the aid. 5 Years Ago 2017 - The Year in Review Many seeds planted in years past bore fruit in 2017. New money for our students and teachers and for families in need of food, expanded health benefits for Marianas veterans and a new troop store - legislative projects I began years ago became reality this year. 10 Years Ago $938,704 awarded for vaccination program The Center for Disease Control announced the award of $938,704 to the Commonwealth's Department of Public Health. This grant is for 2013, the first year in a five-year Immunization and Vaccines for Children Program. The funds, authorized in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ""Obamacare,"" are to be used to immunize individuals against vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, rubella, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, varicella, mumps, haemophilus influenza type b, influenza, and pneumococcal pneumonia. ﻿ OPPORTUNITIES Grants: Interior Technical Assistance Program Grants ﻿ LEGISLATIVE HIGHLIGHTS THIS WEEK Senate Amendment to H.R. 2617 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 , became public law.

66," Dear  , Happy New Year! I hope that this next year is filled with health, happiness, and growth for you and your family. 2022 was a very busy year back home in Virginia and on Capitol Hill. Thank you for following along for all of it. This year, we took many practical steps to protect our communities and support Virginians and Americans across our country. Earlier this year, I voted with a majority of the U.S. House to pass - and the President signed into law - legislation to lower prescription drug costs for seniors, cap the price of insulin for seniors enrolled in Medicare, make recommended vaccines available to Medicare beneficiaries at no cost, and continue to bring down health insurance premiums for Virginia families. Additionally, the President signed into law bipartisan legislation expanding U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare and benefits for Veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances, as well as Veterans of the Vietnam, Gulf War, and post-9/11 eras. Additionally, the President signed into law bipartisan legislation to increase U.S. manufacturing capacity and domestic supply of semiconductors, strengthen America's semiconductor industry, prevent shortages, and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign-made semiconductors. Also just this month, the President signed into law my bipartisan Securing America's Borders Against Fentanyl Act to protect American lives by improving law enforcement's ability to deter, detect, and interdict fentanyl shipments coming through the nation's borders and ports of entry. I am proud to have introduced 40 pieces of legislation this year - 38 of which were bipartisan, 20 of which were passed by a majority of my colleagues in the U.S. House, and 14 were signed into law by the President! Just this past week, the President signed into law an end-of-year package to fund the federal government - which included four bipartisan bills that I have been proud to lead. This package includes my legislation to remove barriers for farmers to participate in voluntary carbon markets and bring farmers to the table on the issue of climate change, as well as a bill to provide refurbished government computers to Veterans, students, and seniors who need them. Additionally, I am proud that this package includes my bipartisan legislation named after retired Virginia police officer Wally Bunker to protect a key tax benefit for retired police officers and firefighters to pay for their health coverage. This package also includes my legislation named in honor of Summer Barrow, a young Virginian who lost her life to a fentanyl overdose, that will combat rising rates of overdose in communities across Virginia and the United States. In 2023, I will continue to work for you. I will continue working to lower healthcare costs, prescription drug costs, grocery costs, and costs overall for you and your family. I will continue working to rebuild our physical infrastructure to grow our local economy. I will remain focused on protecting the rights of all Virginians. And I will continue my commitment to curbing violence in our communities, stopping the flow of illicit drugs across our borders, supporting our local and federal law enforcement officers, and keeping all Virginians safe. Again, happy New Year to you and yours! Sincerely, Abigail ‌ ‌ ‌ Rep.

67," From Dr. Murphy's Desk Dear Friend, Thank you for taking the time to read my most recent updates from Eastern North Carolina and Washington, D.C. As always, it remains a true honor and a privilege to represent you in Congress! If this email was forwarded to you, you can subscribe to my e-newsletter here . In the District As we look back on this year, it has undoubtedly been plagued by a myriad of self-inflicted crises in our economy, at the pump, and at the border, to name a few. Rest assured, under a Republican majority next year, we will work to tackle these crises head on by curbing wasteful spending, unleashing American energy, and securing our border once and for all. You can read about some of our plans in our Commitment to America . I hope everyone enjoyed a safe and happy holiday season this year. As we head into the New Year, please join me in thanking all of our servicemen and women at home and abroad who spent their holidays away from family so we could enjoy our many freedoms here in North Carolina. Congratulations to the East Carolina University Pirates and Coach Mike Houston for their big win in the Birmingham Bowl this week! Your success this season has made us all proud in Eastern North Carolina, and we are looking forward to another outstanding season next year. In Washington This week, I was glad to have legislation signed into law. Rep. Vern Buchanan's VETS Credit Act was signed by the President on Wednesday, which included my bill that makes it easier for dependents of veterans or active-duty military to retain transferred Post-9/11 G.I. Bill benefits. This is a tremendous step for our outstanding military families and ensures they receive the benefits they deserve. I'd like to thank Congressman Buchanan for including this essential piece of legislation in his bill and the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) for bringing it to my attention. You can read more about my bill here . Last week, I voted against the Democrats' $1.7 trillion omnibus package. Unfortunately, Democrats once again engaged in reckless spending over actual solutions that address the many crises we face today. Americans don't want 4,000-plus pages of left-wing projects; they want lower prices, cheap gas, a secure border, and a nation that's safe. You can read more on my vote here . In the News 103.7 WTIB I joined Henry Hinton last week to discuss the Democrats' weaponization of the IRS and news of the day.

68," You Don't Want to Miss This! Dear Friend, I wish you and your loved ones a new year filled with peace, joy, love and good health. Have fun and be safe ringing in 2023. I can't believe that nearly two years ago, I was sworn in to represent California's 39th District. I am honored to be your voice in Congress. I came to Congress to bring some common sense to Washington, break through the partisan gridlock and get things done. I am proud of what my team and I accomplished. My team helped more than 3,500 people with casework requests at federal agencies like the IRS, Veterans Administration and Small Business Administration. We've returned over $17 million to taxpayers through casework. Additionally, I was able to secure resources for key priorities in our area, including for the North Orange County Public Safety Task Force, State Route 91 Improvements, health training programs, wildfire protection and more. In Congress, 29 of my bills have passed the House and 10 have been signed into law. I was named a Common Ground Champion for my commitment and record of breaking through partisan gridlock. I've enjoyed being able to hear your concerns during my telephone town hall meetings, webinars, and in person at the hundreds of public events my team and I have attended. It's a privilege to represent you in Congress. As always, my team and I are here to serve you.

69," Can't see the pictures? Select ""Always display images"" or Click here to open in browser . Historic Wins for San Francisco Funding People Over Politics Last week, the Democratic Congress passed bicameral, bipartisan legislation to keep the federal government open and working For The People. This funding package addresses the needs of America's working families, with a special focus on our children: securing critical investments in their health, housing, education and economic well-being. This legislation is about honoring our heroes, from delivering a major investment in veterans' health care to delivering for our everyday heroes - the people who make our country work and our communities thrive. This package includes key victories for the people of San Francisco: Keeping the Bayview-Hunters Point community safe with environmental cleanup Providing the Presidio Trust with $90 million in loan funds, in addition to the $70 million in loan funds secured by the Speaker over the last three fiscal years Holding polluters accountable and doubling funding to enhance the San Francisco Bay Combating homelessness with $3.633 billion in Homeless Assistance Grants to support permanent supportive and rapid rehousing Rebuilding our infrastructure and creating good-paying jobs with robust transit capital grants, including support for BART Transbay Corridor and Caltrain Electrification Funding critical efforts to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic, aiming to reduce new HIV infections by 90 percent in ten years Defending tribal lands and wildlife by blocking a proposal to raise Shasta Dam Promoting our families' health with increased funding for life-saving research at the National Institutes of Health, including its top public institution recipient: the University of California, San Francisco Nearly $30 million for San Francisco community projects , from alleviating food insecurity and supporting neighborhood-serving organizations to helping our local veterans A Happy and Healthy New Year However you celebrate, may this holiday season bring you peace, warmth and precious time with loved ones.

70," Dear Friends, As my time in the U.S. Congress winds down, I wanted to close this final newsletter by saying what a privilege it has been to represent you in Washington. It has been my heartfelt honor to serve, represent, and fight for you. I have been blessed to get to travel to every corner of our district, to tour MO-4's businesses, to read to elementary students and visit with high school students in our schools, to meet with senior citizens at senior centers and local veterans' events, to see American-made goods being manufactured in our factories, to support our men and women in uniform and their families at our military bases, to be inspired by so many nonprofits helping those making a better life for themselves, to pray with our pastors, and to visit with farmers and ranchers who are feeding the world. I never grew tired of seeing the baby calves frolicking in spring pastures, traveling the miles of winding roads through the beautiful Ozarks, or watching a sunset over the lakes on the drive home. I am so proud of this district and believe the values we hold dear and the commonsense ideas we embrace are what our country needs. I have tried to listen and learn; to fight and cast your vote with thought, purpose, and commitment. It has been my goal to adhere to the advice given to me when I first came to Congress, ""Don't forget where you came from!"" As a 'farm girl from Archie' who came home every weekend, I believe I never did. The following ""Record of Results"" highlights some of our work. I hope you enjoy reviewing it and will feel you made a difference in this nation during the past 12 years. It was your ideas and your priorities that I brought to Washington. Thank you for giving me that opportunity. I want to thank my dedicated staff for partnering with me to make these initiatives possible. The talented ""Mo-4-U-Team"" worked hard in D.C. and in our district for you. Their dedication, breadth of knowledge, and wise counsel helped decipher complicated issues, assist constituents, and move our priorities forward. I am grateful for their commitment to public service and their willingness to be part of the team. I am also grateful for my family-my husband Lowell, daughter Tiffany, and extended family who believed in me, supported the mission, sacrificed time, ate reheated meals, and gave unwavering love and support throughout these twelve years. I couldn't have done this without them. I look forward to what the future holds and to seeing many of you in the district. Thank you for all of your input in this process and your prayers. It has been the honor of a lifetime. May God bless you and may God bless America.

71," December 30, 2022 About Tim Services Media Center Legislative Work Dear Friend, As the year comes to a close, I wanted to share some top highlights of the work my office has done on behalf of the people of South Carolina and to advance my Opportunity Agenda across the country. Please remember to follow me on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , LinkedIn , and YouTube for regular updates on how I am serving the people of South Carolina! Legislative Wins This year, I introduced 18 bills, 7 resolutions, and 13 amendments. Twenty-one pieces of my legislation were in part or fully enacted this year! Before the 117th Congress adjourned for the year, Democrats rushed a bloated omnibus spending package through. While I opposed their ramped up spending, I was able to secure passage of many bills and provisions that I led or supported in the accompanying legislative package. Click here to read a full list of those wins. Serving South Carolina Constituent relations has been a priority of mine since I first entered Congress, and it remains a top priority. Throughout this year, my communication with constituents increased by nearly 70% through our letter program, amounting to more than 17,000 letters sent in 2022 alone. I was also able to help thousands of South Carolinians through casework, fixing issues with federal agencies, delayed passports, or missing benefits. This year, I was able to continue to provide support and aid to the South Carolina Port Authority in its harbor deepening project . Earlier this month, I joined leaders from around the state to celebrate Charleston becoming home to the deepest port on the East Coast. I believe in the power of small businesses, and because of this focus and my team's efforts, we were able to strengthen the Minority Business Development Agency, securing South Carolina a grant for $1.6 million. Standing with Law Enforcement Our law enforcement officers need our support now more than ever. That's why I've committed to increase funding for training for police departments across the country. I was honored to receive a number of awards from law enforcement organizations in recognition of this work. At the beginning of this month, I received the Federal Law Enforcement Foundation's National Service Award. In July, the Florida Sheriffs Association's awarded me their National Legislative Champion Award, and in February, Major County Sheriffs of America , gave me their legislative champion award. The Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act that I sponsored was passed and signed into law. This bill will equip law enforcement officers with the tools to effectively and safely respond to people in crisis. The new requirements for developing de-escalation training standards contained in the bill are the same requirements included in my JUSTICE Act, which was introduced in 2020. Striving for Justice & Fairness One of the marquee achievements this year was the passage of my anti-lynching legislation , named in honor of Emmett Till. I first introduced the bipartisan legislation in 2018. This is a key component of my broader mission to combat hate crimes, which has included speaking out against bomb threats at HBCUs and forming the Senate Caucus on Black-Jewish Relations. To ensure all Americans have the fair access to disaster relief, I worked to have FEMA change its disaster relief policies that discriminated against Black homeowners. Known as heirs property, more than a third of Black-owned land in the South is passed down informally, rather than through deeds and wills, which precluded those land owners from getting much-needed FEMA aid after natural disasters. Following this push and policy change, 42,000 homeowners and 53,000 renters nationwide-who would have previously been denied-received disaster assistance, totaling $350 million. Fighting for Common Sense, Parents, and Students As the co-chair of the Congressional School Choice Caucus, I hosted the i naugural School Choice Caucus Breakfast with dozens of Congressional and education leaders to call attention to the growing nationwide support for school choice and fight against the Biden administration's attempts to limit education options for students. I also led the charge to get answers from Education Secretary Miguel Cardona on his coordination with the National School Boards Association that led to concerned parents being labeled as domestic terrorists. As the co-chair of the bipartisan HBCU Caucus, I was able to host the first ever HBCU Career Fair in conjunction with Benedict College. The event served as a forum to foster public-private partnerships and introduce students and alumni to career, fellowship, and internship opportunities with South Carolina's top employers. As the co-chair of the Congressional Financial Literacy Caucus, I had the opportunity to co-lead a resolution designating April as Financial Literacy Month and led a forum on the importance of youth financial literacy. Additionally, I spearheaded efforts to build consumers' financial capability and broader economic well-being. Standing Up for Seniors Serving as the ranking member on the Aging Committee, my team led the charge to reopen Social Security field offices . After being closed for more than a year due to COVID, our pressure campaign to reopen allowed seniors and people with disabilities to once again receive in-person services for the benefits they deserve. Throughout the year, we led a series of reports on issues that represent national imperatives for older Americans including senior nutrition programs , financial literacy , senior housing , retirement security , drug pricing , and home and community-based services . Our efforts also focused on combating frauds and scams that target seniors through the publication of an annual Fraud Book , holding hearings investigating frauds , and implementing a Fraud Hotline to support seniors. Expanding Health Care Through combined efforts with my Senate colleagues, we urged the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to support and strengthen the Medicare Advantage (MA) program. With great success, CMS announced lower than expected premiums for individuals utilizing the MA program, which covers one third of the Medicare enrollees across South Carolina. Strengthening America & Supporting our Allies I will always stand with our Israeli allies and fight against threats to peace and stability in the Middle East. That's why I introduced the Commission of Inquiry (COI) Elimination Act, a bipartisan bill to withhold U.S. funding for the United Nation Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for their targeted and biased investigation into Israel. I also introduced the Solidify Iran Sanctions Act , which would make permanent sanctions against Iran's energy sector. Looking Ahead I would not have been able to do all this important work without your continued support. Thank you for putting your faith in me and my team as we continue to fight for you. As we look ahead to 2023, I look forward to the new challenges and opportunities to deliver even more results. I wish you and your family many blessings and good health in the New Year.

That's why I'm asking you to take a few moments to answer the survey below. As we look toward 2023, I want to know your priorities for the New Year. What is your top priority for Congress? Addressing high prices and inflation Lowering prescription drug and health care costs Combating climate change Protecting our democracy Investing in infrastructure Other Submit survey to sign up for updates on my work in Congress.* It's been a busy year in New Jersey and Washington. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we've delivered billions of dollars to New Jersey to try to lower costs and rebuild our infrastructure. My office also returned over $12.8 million to constituents. If you need help with a federal agency, please do not hesitate to reach out to our offices. The contact information is below. I'm proud of everything my office has accomplished in 2022, and I'm looking forward to serving you in 2023. Here's a look at what we accomplished in 2022: Federal Spending Bill Will Help Expand Health Care and Protect Consumers This week, President Biden signed a federal spending bill into law. As Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I'm proud to have secured provisions in the bill that will increase access to health care and establish critically important consumer protections. The government funding agreement guarantees 12 months of continuous Medicaid coverage for 40 million of our nation's children, provides two years of additional CHIP funding, and permanently extends the option for states to offer 12 months of Medicaid coverage to new moms. In addition, it provides resources and support to address our nation's mental health and substance use disorder crises, which we know are especially acute among young people. The bill equips the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) with important new tools and resources to fulfill their missions protecting the health and safety of Americans. After more than 80 years since our cosmetic safety laws were last updated, Congress is passing legislation I've long championed to empower FDA with the tools and resources it needs to oversee the cosmetics industry. This is a huge win for consumers. Finally, the bill will guard consumers against counterfeit and dangerous products, bolster U.S. manufacturing, and continue to promote our economic competitiveness on the world stage. I'm proud Democrats were able to secure so many important health care and consumer protection provisions in this bill. Read more here My Veterans Bill Is Now Law My Homeless Veterans Credit Repair, Enhancement, and Debt Improvement for Tomorrow (CREDIT) Act was signed into law. The bill was included in the Omnibus Spending Bill for Fiscal Year 2023 and will help end veteran homelessness and housing instability by providing credit and financial counseling - a top ten unmet need for homeless veterans. During this time of economic uncertainty, we must look out for our most vulnerable communities, including homeless veterans and those at risk of becoming homeless. My bill will give us a better understanding of how to improve the services offered to our nation's heroes. Read more here I want to wish you and your family a Happy New Year.

76," 17th District Email Me Media Center Legislation Serving You December 29 Fireside Sessions Merry Christmas & Happy New Years I hope everyone's Christmas was restful and full of cheer. As the year 2022 concludes, I would like to reflect on a couple of key moments in Congress and our Texas 17th Congressional District this year. Moreover, I believe these moments can provide a sense of aspiration for the 118th Congress, starting January 3rd. I am looking forward to the new year, and I hope you are too. The 118th House of Representatives After a hard-fought victory, Republicans are officially the Majority party in the U.S. House of Representatives. With the American people's blessing, we will be able to stymy the Democrat and Biden administration's radical agenda. The Republican Party agenda will address many topics that have been put off and solve our nation's most pressing issues. I would like to thank my constituents again for their overwhelming support during the 2022 midterm elections. With it, I will continue to fight for our way of life in Central Texas and provide more opportunities for individuals to increase their standard of living. Texans for a Secure Border 2022 has been a hard year for many counties and families who bear the daily costs of our unsecured southern border. While the Biden administration insists it is under control, the American people know the truth. Every city has become a border city as illegal aliens are released across different regions of our country. This December my GOP colleagues from Texas and I unveiled our plan to secure the border in 2023. Our framework to address our border crisis includes completing physical border infrastructure, fixing border enforcement policies, enforcing our laws in the interior of the United States, and targeting cartels and criminal organizations. Securing our southern border will be a top priority for us Texas Republicans next year. FY2023 District Projects Last year, my office worked hard to secure federal funding for several projects in our congressional district. They will allow our communities to grow to meet our increasing infrastructure and population needs. I am proud of the priorities listed above and I believe these developments will support Central & East Texas' position as one of the nation's most sought-after places to live, work, learn, and raise a family.

In 2022, during one of the most productive Congresses in American history, I introduced and helped pass key bipartisan legislation, delivered critical project funding for the region, and directly helped almost 20,000 constituents with cases involving federal issues. Some of this year's major legislative highlights include passing the historic Inflation Reduction Act to lower prescription drug prices, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to reduce gun violence, the CHIPs and Science Act, to boost American manufacturing, and the PACT Act, to allow veterans exposed to toxins to get the care they need. As we reflect back on 2022, I've continued my track record of delivering top-notch constituent services and building relationships with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get things done for Northeast Pennsylvanians. It's an honor to serve you, and I look forward to continuing to fight for hardworking families in our district in the next Congress and beyond. For a list of my personal highlights in 2022, read on. My Camp Lejeune Justice Act Signed into Law In August, I was honored to attend the bill signing ceremony at the White House for the PACT Act, which included my Camp Lejeune Justice Act. The service members who signed up to defend their country and the people who supported them at Camp Lejeune were let down by their government in a big way. Over a 30-year period, thousands of Marines, their families, civilian workers and personnel used government provided tap water that was contaminated with harmful chemicals. It's estimated that more than a million people were exposed, and more than 500,000 people may have suffered devastating health effects. Having the Camp Lejeune Justice Act signed into law provides an important step forward to ensure military families, civil servants and contractors can now receive the benefits and health care they deserve. The Most Bipartisan Democrat in the Past Ten Years At the Luzerne County Flood Protection Authority's new headquarters this past October, I introduced the Prepare Act in order to improve government readiness for extreme weather disasters. The PREPARE Act also served as a major milestone in my service as a U.S. Congressman, marking the 150 th bipartisan bill I introduced, the most of any Democratic member of Congress during my tenure. When it comes to the 118th Congress, m y approach will remain the same. I'm committed to promoting bipartisanship and making connections with my colleagues across the aisle to uplift Northeast Pennsylvania, move our country forward, and put people over politics. The Return of Rail This year, we moved yet another step closer to reestablishing passenger rail service from Scranton to New York City. In June, I officially submitted an ""Expression of Interest"" letter to the Federal Railroad Administration, calling for a once-in-a-generation investment to bring back rail service to Northeastern Pennsylvania. So far, more than 25 Representatives and Senators from Pennsylvania and New Jersey, along with local government officials and business and tourism leaders, have all signed on with my office as a coalition of ""Lackawanna Cut-Off Interested Parties."" In October, the state also committed close to $4 million in support of the project. We have a critical year ahead of us when it comes to the proposed Amtrak line, and I'll be spending a lot of time bird-dogging this project. Restoring rail service from Scranton to New York City is going to create incredible economic opportunity for the entire region and I'm committed to doing whatever I can to make it happen. Number One in Pennsylvania; Top Ten in the Country As a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I'm committed to bringing our share of federal tax dollars home to Northeastern Pennsylvania, especially for our police, firefighters and first responders. In Fiscal Year 2023, I brought home close to $53 million to the district. In Fiscal Year 2022, I brought home $19.6 million. For my efforts, I was ranked Number One in Pennsylvania two years in a row and am now in the Top Ten in the country for securing Community Project Funding dollars for our district. To read the full list of projects, click here . This upcoming Congress, I'm more committed than ever to bringing federal dollars home to drive regional economic growth, create jobs, fight crime, and provide much-needed public works projects. This funding directly responds to some of the most pressing needs in Northeast Pennsylvania by creating jobs with better pay, making us safer, and strengthening our communities. A New Congress, the Same Goals Since being first sworn into Congress, my focus has remained consistent. In the upcoming 118 th Congress, I'll continue my efforts to strengthen working families, create good-paying jobs, ensure affordable health care, protect our seniors, and support our veterans and military families. I'm looking forward to being sworn-in again this Tuesday and consider it a privilege to continue representing you. Thank you for your confidence in me. Happy New Year!

78," Dear  , Over the holidays, I've had increasing reports from countless constituents across the Second Congressional District that mail delivery service has been poor recently. Constituents in Lakeville, Eagan, Mendota Heights and others have shared with me that they are going 3-4 days without mail. In some cases, South Metro residents have reported going two weeks without receiving their mail. This is unacceptable - and I'm demanding answers from USPS. Today, I wrote to Louis DeJoy, the United States Postmaster General, to demand that he and local officials address the situation and get mail delivery in Minnesota's Second District back on track. You can see the text of my letter below. I know our postal service employees and letter carriers are working overtime and doing their best to try and get us our packages and letters. But something is impacting operational planning that USPS must address. The letter can be found below. I encourage you to contact my office if you are having any trouble navigating or accessing any federal agency, including your local post offices. For assistance, please visit . December 30, 2022 Mr. Louis DeJoy Postmaster General United States Postal Service 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Room 10300 Washington, D.C. 20260-1000 Dear Postmaster General DeJoy: I write to you today with great frustration regarding the state of mail delivery service across the Second Congressional District of Minnesota. My constituents have reported to me that they regularly go three to four days without receiving their mail; some have told me they haven't received mail since December 16, 2022 - now 2 weeks ago. I've been told by local postal officials that a route would never go unserved for more than one day at a time, but it's clear that is simply not the case. The United States Postal Service's creed reads, ""Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night,"" and yet seniors and veterans are going without medication, businesses are missing payments and families are not receiving packages from loved ones during the holiday season. This is entirely unacceptable. On November 5, I wrote to the USPS regarding the situation in Lakeville. On December 8, I held a call with the relevant USPS official for Minnesota, and yet still the poor delivery service has continued not just in Lakeville, but across the Second District. Short-staffing and increased holiday shipping volumes are understandable, but are beginning to sound like excuses. This no longer seems to be isolated to neighborhoods or even individual cities, but rather a larger issue across Minnesota. My constituents deserve answers and I request your response to the following questions: For each post office in the Second District, since December 16, 2022, how many routes at each location went unserved and which day? For each post office in the Second District, what are the current staffing shortages and how quickly will USPS be able to be fully staffed? Which post offices in the Second District have had to deliver ""package only"" routes, which requires flats to go undelivered, and on which days? What power does the Postal Service hold to ""surge"" employees to necessary routes, and how can the hiring process be expedited to make the necessary deliveries on time? How many packages, as of this letter, remain undelivered at each post office in the Second District? Thank you for reviewing this letter and I look forward to your response on behalf of all Second District residents who deserve to have their medications, bills and packages arrive safely and on time.

79," News from Congressman Brian Mast ABOUT GET HELP NEWS CONTACT YEAR IN REVIEW: VICTORIES FOR VETERANS   - In my opinion, it's never going to be 'good enough' when it comes to the care veterans receive. That's why looking out for my brothers and sisters in arms is one of my top priorities in Congress. Thankfully, we had some major wins this year. From simple bills that will help streamline services and cut through red tape, to major legislation that will finally force the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to recognize the health consequences of burn pits and other airborne toxins, Congress was able to put aside partisan politics and come together for those who've served. We made good progress, but we can't settle. That's why I'll continue fighting for veterans in Congress with the same commitment that they showed when they fought for our nation on the battlefield.

81," Dear Friend, As we approach the end of the year, I want to wish you and your family a happy holiday season. I'm grateful to the people of California for putting their faith in me to represent them in the United States Senate, and I'm looking forward to the work ahead on your behalf. The holiday season is not only an opportunity to spend time with friends and family, it's also a moment to pause and reflect on the past year. I'm proud to look back and say that in 2022, we made significant progress for all Californians - from cutting costs for families to taking historic action to confront the climate crisis, and more. Here are some of the accomplishments I'm celebrating from the past year: Pictured: Senator Padilla at a press conference outside the Capitol in support of the Inflation Reduction Act Lowering costs for families and passing the largest investment in history to confront the climate crisis. In August, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act - bold and transformative legislation to bring down the cost of health care and life-saving medications for millions of Californians. With this bill, we took historic action to combat the climate crisis with the seriousness it deserves, by making significant investments in clean energy. Pictured: Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson joins Senator Padilla in his office Voting to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. In April, I was proud to cast my vote for the historic confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the United States Supreme Court. As the first Black woman confirmed to our nation's highest court, Justice Jackson is a trailblazing public servant, and she brings commitment to equal rights and equal justice to the Supreme Court at a time when many of our fundamental rights are under attack. A highlight of the confirmation hearings: Justice Jackson's inspiring words on perseverance when I asked her what advice she had for young people. Pictured: Senator Padilla working alongside farmworkers picking radishes Leading the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and fighting for immigrant communities. As the proud son of immigrants from Mexico, I'm honored to serve as the first Latino to Chair the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety. From chairing hearings in Washington on the vital role of immigrants in our classrooms and our hospitals , to working on my hands and knees alongside farmworkers in Moorpark - I'm proud of all that we accomplished in 2022 to lift up the voices of immigrant communities and fight to expand access to the American Dream for all. Pictured: Senator Padilla with Marty Buno, Senior Aviation Officer of CAL FIRE's Aviation Management Unit Successfully passing my bill to improve our wildfire preparedness and response efforts. We wrapped up the year with a major victory after my FIRE Act was passed unanimously in the Senate and by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in the House. The legislation will bolster our federal response to wildfires, because protecting our communities from catastrophes should always come before politics. My team has helped thousands of Californians secure millions of dollars that they are owed by federal agencies. If you or a loved one needs help navigating the federal government, please do not hesitate to contact my office.

82," December 30, 2022 Friends, I hope you had a very Merry Christmas with your families. I wanted to provide you with a few updates regarding what's going on and highlight some of our top accomplishments in the 117th Congress - Preparing for the 118th Congress On Tuesday, Republicans will have the Majority in the House of Representatives to end two long years of one-party rule in Washington. There is a lot of work that needs to be done in Congress, and we've got an uphill battle to fight as the Senate and White House are still Democrat-controlled. Despite this, we will hold Democrats accountable through rigorous oversight. I will fight for fiscal responsibility in Congress, continue standing for our constitutional rights, and demand transparency and answers for the American people. On January 3, the House will no longer be controlled by Nancy Pelosi, and the balance of power will flip in America's favor! Stay tuned for what's coming! The 117th Congress in Review Despite being under one-party rule for the past two years, we accomplished a lot in the 117th Congress. This Congress, I cast over 900 votes, introduced 27 bills, and cosponsored over 400 pieces of legislation on a range of issues, from energy independence to securing our southern border to protecting our constitutional rights and honoring our commitments to our veterans. I also responded to over 50,000 letters from constituents on various issues they care about. We exposed the Biden Administration's terrible energy policies that are forcing families to pay more at the pump, called for the Keystone XL pipeline to be finished, pushed legislation to prohibit Biden from selling our strategic oil reserves to China, and offered solutions to expand energy production here in the United States. I rolled out a comprehensive plan to expand nuclear energy here at home, and brought Members of Congress from across the country to South Carolina to show how we're leading the way in our all-of-the-above energy strategy. I pushed legislation to protect minors from deeply-damaging hormone treatment and gender procedures and from woke left-wing indoctrination in our nation's schools. I also exposed a South Carolina education group that believes children under ten should be exposed to sexually explicit content and called on schools to cut ties with the organization. I fought against all COVID shot mandates and personally led the charge to eliminate the COVID vaccine requirement for healthcare workers. While we have more to do, we recently had a major victory by forcing Democrats to eliminate all COVID shot mandates for our military. I stood for the Constitution and the 2nd Amendment by sponsoring and cosponsoring over a dozen pieces of legislation that will protect our right to keep and bear arms, and I'm ready to take the Biden Administration to court if they push any for any executive actions against our gun rights. I fought for fiscal responsibility and voted against over $5 trillion in reckless government spending, spending that contributed to soaring inflation and rising costs of living. We conducted extensive oversight of the Biden Administration and laid the foundations for extensive investigations on their botched Afghanistan withdrawal, southern border crisis, inflationary spending policies, war on American energy, and violating Americans' First Amendment rights by colluding with Big Tech to silence free speech. I led an amicus brief to the US Supreme Court so that South Carolina could delist Planned Parenthood as a Medicaid Provider and celebrated the historic overturning of Roe v. Wade. I had two bills signed into law to rename local post offices for fallen American heroes and facilitated the promotion of World War II veteran, Bataan Death March survivor, and long-time Clemson Professor Ben Skardon to the rank of Brigadier General before he passed away at the age of 104. After 12 years of hard work and more than 30 meetings with the Corps of Engineers, we celebrated the completion of the deepening of the Port of Charleston, which makes it the deepest on the east coast, creating jobs and benefiting the entire state. Most importantly, I worked for the people of the Third District of South Carolina, whether that was voting for policies that promote limited government, individual liberties, and South Carolina values, helping folks with federal agencies, assisting with passports and grants, and making memories for families visiting Washington. Despite a Democrat-controlled Congress and White House, we stood up for YOUR priorities, and this is just a quick glimpse into what we fought for and accomplished. I look forward to the 118th Congress with a Republican majority, so we can take steps to hold Democrats accountable and fight for conservative common-sense policies to help the American people.

84," Friday, December 30, 2022 WEBSITE | SHARE ON: Foxx Report This week, my bill, the War Crimes Rewards Expansion Act , was signed into law. For far too long, the United States' policy has elevated international tribunals over the work of national governments when prosecuting the world's worst culprits: those engaging in genocide and war crimes. The International Criminal Court has recently utilized its time and resources in investigating the United States and Israel all while failing to hold our adversaries accountable. China's genocidal campaign against the Uyghurs continues unabated, North Korea continues to engage in crimes against humanity with impunity, and ISIS fighters guilty of genocide continue to blend into populations without ever facing justice. The United States needs to end this reliance on international tribunals and display true leadership, and the reforms made by my bill will empower our government to do so. By focusing our resources on prosecutions by national governments - including by utilizing U.S. laws already on the books - our government can track down perpetrators like members of ISIS swiftly and without the bureaucratic entanglements of international tribunals. I am immensely pleased to see my bill's passage in the United States Senate and its subsequent signing into law. Without question, this bipartisan effort sends a robust, rock-ribbed message to the entire world: the United States is determined to protect its sovereignty and its interests with every tool necessary. Standing Up For Parents Recently, I sent letters to Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Xavier Becerra and multiple hospitals that conduct gender-transition interventions to children about policies that deny parents the opportunity to be involved in life-altering medical decisions impacting their children. Here's a short excerpt: ""While some states have safeguards in place to protect children from these unsafe medical protocols, several states have adopted broad nondiscrimination policies based on gender identity that jeopardize parental rights. … One of the most harmful actions occurs when government agencies intervene between children and parents, as when CPS removes a child from the custody of his or her parents because the parents will not consent to their child undergoing these experimental treatments."" To view all six letters that I have sent on this issue, click here . The $1.7 Trillion Omnibus Last week, the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill was rammed through Congress right before Christmas. The Democrat-led House and Senate decided to go shopping for as many stocking stuffers as they could get their hands on - and they used the hard-earned money of American taxpayers to do so. As you may know, this bill was packed to the gills with pet projects, earmarks, and everything including the kitchen sink. This was not a thoughtful and good-faith effort - it was highway robbery in 4,155 pages of legislative text. During the 117th Congress, congressional Democrats have rammed through numerous spending bills without any concern for what havoc they might wreak upon this country. This bill was no different, and it was a last-ditch effort to buoy their political allies before Republicans take the majority in January. Every American will surely feel the sharp sting of the slap in the face that this sham bill will render. Rest assured that I cast a strong NO vote against this monstrosity.

85," Blaine's Bulletin: 2022 in Review December 30, 2022D For Immediate Release | Contact: Georgeanna Sullivan (202) 225-2956 Blaine's Bulletin: 2022 in review December 30, 2022 For Immediate Release | Contact: Georgeanna Sullivan (202) 225-2956 Blaine's Bulletin: 2022 in review As we head into a new year, I find it's always productive to reflect on what worked, and what could be done differently moving forward for the next twelve months. 2022 had its fair share of ups and downs, but a new year brings a new beginning and a clean slate. Next year, with a House Republican majority, I'm optimistic that we can do some good. Of course, Democrats are still in control of the White House and Senate so bipartisanship will be key to get things done. There will still be plenty of tough negotiating (and needless bickering) but there will also be opportunities to rein in the government's spending and heavy-handed regulation. House Republicans have our Commitment to America plan that would bring down historic inflation, secure our border, and turn the American energy spigot back on so families can put gas in their cars and heat their homes without spending a small fortune. These are just a few of our priorities, but we're ready to do the work to make life easier for American families. One of my office's most important functions is helping Third District constituents with casework. We're here to be a liaison when you run into issues with federal agencies, which happens all too often. This year I'm very proud that we were able to resolve 576 cases for Missouri residents, including help with IRS, the Veterans Administration, passports, Social Security, and the Small Business Administration. COVID, and excessive work-from-home policies, caused massive backlogs at federal agencies. My staff and I worked hard to sift through the bureaucratic muck to get you the money you've been waiting on, the passport you needed to finally start traveling again, the medical attention our veterans need, and the services so many people in our area depend on. While some of those backlogs have improved, there are plenty of people still waiting on a satisfactory response from the government, and we'll continue advocating for you in 2023 and beyond. This new Congressional session also brings a change in our district boundaries. As you know, every ten years Congressional districts are reapportioned to ensure each district has the same number of constituents. Unfortunately, the Third District is losing Lincoln Country, Franklin County, and parts of Camden, Jefferson, and Warren Counties. Our boundaries in St. Charles County are also changing. While I look forward to serving our new constituents in Boone, Cooper, Crawford, Moniteau, and Washington Counties, we are disappointed to no longer serve so many of the people we've formed great working and personal relationships with. From WashMo, to Troy, to Camdenton, I've met countless incredible people who I have been honored to represent. If you are one of the many people who will not be in the new Third District next year, please know you are always welcome to contact our office anytime you need help. We are happy to work with you and our colleagues in the Missouri Congressional delegation to ensure your needs are met. Thank you for trusting me to serve you and your families for another term in Congress as the Representative of Missouri's Third District. I'm very proud to do it and look forward to getting to work for you again. Happy New Year!

Our servicemen and women have made incredible sacrifices in order to keep us safe, and we are forever indebted to them for their service. This year, I had the opportunity to meet with many of our nation's servicemembers and military leaders, as well as leaders of U.S. ally nations to discuss national security priorities throughout the world.

Virginia's First District is blessed with an abundance of natural resources that we have a duty to preserve and protect. In Washington, I work to promote policies that safeguard our environment, including our waters, lands, and wildlife. I understand the importance of protecting our environment, and it remains a priority of mine to engage in these conservation efforts firsthand in the district. Like many of you, I've spent countless hours outdoors hunting, fishing, and enjoying the natural beauty of the environment around us. As a lifelong outdoorsman, I know the important role that our sportsmen and women play in maintaining our environment. I've enjoyed meeting many of the hunters and anglers in the First District, and I'm looking forward to continuing my work in Washington to ensure that our natural resources can continue to be enjoyed by tourists, sportsmen and women, and conservationists.

This week, I published the following notional resignation letter from the perspective of an active duty servicemember, voicing his frustration with DoD leadership and poor quality of life for our military personnel in the armed forces. Our servicemembers and their families sacrifice so much to serve and protect our nation, yet they are treated worse than they deserve. This letter sums up all the challenges they must overcome just to barely make ends meet. I hope you'll take a moment to read through it. I remain focused on fighting for our military servicemembers and doing what is needed to provide for them as they provide for us. And I'm proud of my Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act which should hopefully be signed into law before the new year. Click here or scroll below to read the letter: My Formal Resignation Letter A letter by Rep. Mike Garcia detailing the hardships placed on servicemembers due to low quality of life and poverty level pay from the perspective of an active duty servicemember. To whom it may concern, This letter is written to officially notify you that I will not be continuing my service at the end of my commitment. While I have enjoyed serving in the U.S. military, I have found the sacrifices too costly relative to the fulfillment of serving my country and quality of life. Amid record low Department of Defense (DoD) recruitment and retention, this letter serves not only as a notification of resignation, but also a genuine attempt to convey ""why"" I'm leaving. My hope is that the DoD leadership (including the President of the United States) and Congress will address and resolve these issues. I want only the best for my nation and for its military to be more attractive to future servicemembers than it is for our current servicemembers. I knew when I enlisted that my base pay would start at $21,000 per year. While this is anemic pay, I was willing to enlist for that much. This is roughly $12 per hour when normalized on a 40-hour weekly income. After three years of service, I am just now making the equivalent of $15 per hour. With the current record inflation rates at 8%, the roughly 4% pay raises each year actually put my family in the hole. Is there any chance that Congress can raise base pay for junior enlisted personnel and tie our pay raises to the current inflation indices so that we are earning at least the same as a McDonald's worker? Despite the low base pay, I figured between my salary and my wife's salary as a nurse, we would be able to make ends meet if we lived on base housing and were able to take advantage of the day care services on base for our three-year-old daughter. Unfortunately, when we received our first orders after boot camp, we learned that my wife would need to requalify and recertify as a Registered Nurse because military spouses aren't offered reciprocity for professional licenses when they move on military orders in some states. This process ended up costing us thousands of dollars and six months, resulting in a massive loss in earnings. Is there some way to allow active duty military spouses to receive reciprocity for their professional licenses across all state lines without having to wait and pay for the credentials all over again? When we arrived in California, we were told there was a wait to get into base housing due to massive renovations of the old housing units due to asbestos issues. My admin department told me I would qualify for a $2,700 housing allowance since I was forced to live in town. But unfortunately, the rents in the local community for a two-bedroom place in the safe parts of town started at $2,500. So, after utilities, insurance, and gas for driving to and from base, we were losing about $500 (or about 25% of my net base pay) each month on that deal. Is there some way to ensure the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is directly tied to the current rental home market? The other surprise we encountered when we arrived at our duty station was that the on-base childcare facility was not available anymore. We could apply for day care assistance but, again, the subsidy was not enough to cover the costs of day care in town. How is it that we still have major bases in the U.S. that do not have decent childcare for our children? I was deployed to Afghanistan just three months after we arrived at our home station. With work ups and training, my wife was effectively forced to be a single mom trying to not only raise our daughter, but also keep her hours at the hospital. We knew this was a common strain on military families, but we were willing to work through all of this in the interest of serving our beautiful nation. My first tour to Afghanistan in early 2019 was rewarding, and I was proud of the progress the U.S. had provided our allies there over the course of the last twenty years during the Global War on Terror. My unit felt comfortable with the prospects of a smooth transition and departure from Afghanistan, and I had confidence that my leadership and chain of command had a solid plan to make sure we could end this two-decade conflict, come home safely, and not relinquish control back to the Taliban. We were also hopeful that during this down time, we would be provided with refreshed equipment. During our deployment, we lost five members of our platoon because the transport helicopter had a maintenance failure, attributed by a fatigued airframe. The helicopter literally fell apart in midair. Unfortunately, the time between deployments was not used to replace or upgrade our equipment. Instead, we spent that time doing patch work on the existing systems, knowing that we would not be able to get them up to the readiness levels we needed for our next deployment. Is there some way Congress, the Pentagon and Industry can work together to ensure our weapons and equipment are modern and safe before we put our lives on the line? Can they shorten the acquisition timelines so we can get equipment sooner? As I was promoted to E-4 in mid 2020, my wife and I were still struggling to pay the bills. Before that time, we had qualified for food stamps, but the pay raise attached to my E-4 promotion put us above the food stamps qualification levels. Using food stamps while in uniform at the grocery store was one of the most degrading experiences of my life. But I had to do it to avoid insurmountable credit card debt. I figured if I worked hard and studied for the promotion tests every day, I could be promoted to E-5 by the end of 2021. If I was able to do that, my family would finally be able to slightly breath financially. But 2021 ended up being the year that everything changed dramatically, and the financial challenges and any study time took a backseat. In April of 2021, we were in our barracks when our Commander in Chief delivered a press conference. While I'm not a fan of his politics, President Joe Biden is still my Commander in Chief, and my unit was pretty good about not being political, especially while in uniform. But I remember how angry we all were that day when he announced to the world (before he even told his troops), that he was committed to an unconditional withdrawal from Afghanistan by 9/11/21. I remember thinking, ""why the hell would you tell our enemies when we are pulling out before actually making provisions to do it correctly? And why unconditionally?"" Morale was very low. We didn't have the highest regard for our leadership, our operational tempo remained high because our generals wanted to keep flexing their muscle rather than resting their troops and equipment. And we all saw the writing on the wall about the upcoming disaster in Afghanistan. While we only had 2,500 troops left in Afghanistan, the nation was very stable, and we hadn't lost a single American in over a year there. We all wanted to pull out, but not this way. Watching the situation in Afghanistan was like rowing in a lifeboat for twenty years, getting to within a mile of the beach, and having your Skipper pull out a knife to cut a giant hole in the boat. We were so close to wrapping up the campaign in a clean and orderly fashion. Instead, we knew that last mile was going to be painful and dangerous. We knew that last mile was going to cost more American lives, and empower the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. And it did. In the days following the pull out in July of 2021, our unit ended up getting an emergency surge deployment notification with 48 hours' notice. You can imagine the turmoil this caused all our families. Within a few days we were once again boots on the ground in Kabul. Now, instead of 2,500 Americans in the entire country, there were 7,000 of us in one city. Instead of executing a smooth, coordinated handoff on our terms with our Afghan partners and the new government, we had abandoned them in the middle of the night and basically signed their death warrants. And now, instead of being keepers of peace and stability, we were surrounded by the Taliban and hundreds of Al-Qaeda killers that were released from Bagram prison just a few days before we arrived. By mid-August, we were convinced that most of us would be killed as we tried to mop up the mess and get all Americans out before time expired. I recall the overwhelming feeling of betrayal when I realized that our President and our State Department were willing to leave before all Americans were evacuated. And where was Secretary of Defense Austin then? Why did operational control remain with the State Department even after the bullets started flying and lives were lost? This was a damn war zone, and we were being led by diplomats instead of the DoD. Strategic decisions were made by the State Department instead of the Department of Defense. We held olive branches while the bad guys held bombs. The leaders had already stranded American civilians, Afghan SIV partners, and we were convinced they were going to sacrifice or strand most of us who were surrounded by mobs of desperate people and terrorists as we watched fewer and fewer C-17's come in to rescue folks. The death of thirteen of our fellow patriots and hundreds of Afghan civilians on August 26th at the gates of Karzai airport in Kabul was a massive gut punch to us all. We thought it was just a matter of time before our entire unit suffered the same fate. But as painful as the loss of our brothers and sisters was, nothing compared to the pain we all felt when our President called the operation a ""success"" on August 31st. After looking at his watch several times while our fallen troops were unloaded from the cargo planes back at home, President Biden, my Commander, had the audacity to call this unforced and unmitigated nightmare a ""success."" This all after we picked up dead humans who had fallen to their deaths on the runway after clinging to the outside of the transport planes just for a chance to go to the U.S. Calling America's withdrawal from Afghanistan a success is like calling the sinking of the Titanic a success. Lots of people died unnecessarily because leadership failed us. And just because some were saved did not warrant a claim of victory or success. I have no doubt that our weak performance on the global stage during those six months inspired Putin to launch his invasion of Ukraine when he did. No doubt. I am now within six months of my separation date, and I can no longer serve in the military. After two combat tours, I am seeing my senior leadership spend more time focused on the ""woke"" training nonsense than our own readiness. We still don't have the equipment we need to be safe. We have lost five percent of our company as they refused to take the COVID vaccine because of religious beliefs, but they were still discharged. We are not ready for our next deployment. We are not ready for war. We are not ready for China. I do not mind making the financial sacrifices. I do not mind suffering the low quality of life that comes with military service. I am even willing to give my life in defense of this great nation. But what I can't tolerate is weak leadership, politicians, and commanders who neither appreciate their roles as stewards of our military servicemembers or their responsibilities to deter and win wars. After 247 years, the United States still needs warfighters to either deter, or if unable to deter, kill the bad guys before they harm us. But the warfighters won't show up, or won't stay long, if they are treated like plebes, paid less than minimum wage, and moved like pawns by their leadership. I'll be committed to the cause of American liberty for my entire life, but not while wearing the military uniform. I implore the White House, Congress, and the Pentagon to do better and to do more so that future generations will be inspired to serve and remain in the service. You are currently failing us.

90," News from Rep. Bost 2022 In Review Dear Friend, It may be difficult to move a conservative agenda forward in liberal-controlled Washington, but there's no time for excuses. That's why I'm proud of what we've accomplished for Southern Illinois this year. As we close the book on 2022, here's an update on the work I'm doing to grow the economy, strengthen our communities, and defend our values. The policies of the Biden Administration have led to rollercoaster-like conditions for the American economy. At times, it felt more like a freefall. Inflation is sky-high; store shelves are empty; and gas and home energy prices hit their highest levels ever. In response, I voted against Biden's spending spree bill that raised taxes and fueled inflation. I also cosponsored the Critical Infrastructure Manufacturing Feasibility Act and the Ocean Shipping Reform Act to seek solutions for easing the supply chain crisis and eliminating the international backlog on deliveries. I believe much of the recent economic turmoil was rooted in the senseless, unscientific COVID shutdowns that crippled small businesses, cost people their jobs, and left children behind in their educational development. That's why I been vocal in the fight to the Biden administration's Big Government mandates and cosponsored legislation to do just that. One place where a shutdown would actually make sense is at the southern border. According to Fox News, there were 73,000 ""got-aways"" crossing the border last month alone. And with fentanyl flooding our streets, there is no denying we are facing a crisis. That's why I voted against Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi's amnesty policies, while supporting the HALT Fentanyl Act and FIGHT Fentanyl Act to make the Schedule I classification for fentanyl permanent. This year we also experienced hot button battles over abortion and gun control. I supported the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and restore the American people's power in determining for themselves how abortion services are regulated in their state. I have voted against the Democrats' pro-abortion policy agenda and cosponsored the Protect the UNBORN Act , which would prohibit the funding and implementation of President Biden's pro-abortion executive orders. I've also helped lead the fight to protect our Second Amendment rights. For example, under current law, if a veteran needs help managing their benefits, VA automatically reports them to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which means they could lose their Second Amendment rights. I've been leading efforts to reverse this policy so that law-abiding gun owners don't lose their constitutional rights without Due Process. I'll work to pass this bill in the new Congress. As the incoming chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am honored to be the leading advocate in Congress for America's heroes. Southern Illinois is home to over 55,000 veterans; and as a Marine myself, I don't take my responsibility to them lightly. That's why I've championed the VIPER Act to encourage VA's innovative medical and prosthetic research programs; the Improving Access to the VA Home Loan Benefit Act to streamline the home buying process for veterans; and the STRONG Veterans Act to ensure veterans can get mental health services during their time of need. No doubt, 2022 was a busy year. Please know how honored I am to serve you in Congress, and how much I look forward to hitting the ground running in the new year. I hope you and yours have a happy New Year! Sincerely, Mike Bost   Please do not respond to this email. If you would like to share a comment or concern, please email listeningtoyou@ . ",Bost
91," Welcome to your 2022 Recap ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ News from Representative Hayes Dear  , As the year comes to a close, I would like to reflect on all we have accomplished together in the 117th Congress . In the last two years, Congress has supported once in a generation investments to put people back to work, update and modernize our nation's crumbling infrastructure, and put critical resources in the hands of those who need it most. At the same time, I recognize that like millions of Americans, my constituents are feeling the impact of inflation and increasing costs of living. These pressing issues have solutions and my colleagues and I are acting decisively to fix them. Last week, Congress passed the fiscal year 2023 budget which will help lower the cost of living for working families, create better paying jobs, and keep our nation and communities safe. As your Congresswoman, I have worked alongside local leaders and my colleagues in Congress to ensure priorities of the Fifth District remain top of mind in our federal budget. As such, I am pleased to share the Fifth District of Connecticut will receive more than $23 million in community project funding . These projects will support everything from communications system upgrades for law enforcement to facility infrastructure for community health centers to making groundwork to restore CT Rail from Danbury to New York City. To learn more about the fiscal year 2023 legislative package, please click here . I am proud of all we have accomplished together this term, from advancing key legislation to offering superior constituent service and directing federal resources back to our state. It continues to be my privilege to serve as your representative and I look forward to the work we will do in the 118th Congress. For the full 2022 recap, please read below. Excellence in Constituent Service My office continues to be a resource for constituents looking for help with navigating federal agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Social Security Administration (SSA), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). My team has returned $9.9 million to constituents through assistance with federal agencies and successfully closed more than 750 cases . Additionally, we have had nearly 1.5 million touchpoints in communities across the district through phone calls, emails, and U.S. mail. Hearing directly from my constituents is of the utmost importance to me and I am pleased to engage with you as you learn more about your government and the legislative process. Advancing Critical Legislation In 2022, 5 pieces of my legislation were signed into law including: Housatonic Wild and Scenic River Act This legislation would create a U.S. National Park Service protective designation for 41 miles of the Housatonic River which runs through Sharon, Canaan, Cornwall, Salisbury, New Milford, Kent, and North Canaan. The wild and scenic designation will bring federal resources to the towns along the river to support conservation efforts. The Access to Baby Formula Act The Access to Formula Act would allow for certain program requirements in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to be waived so families can more easily access the infant formula they need during times of crisis. This bipartisan legislation passed the House 414 to 9 and was signed into law on May 21, 2022. Palomares Veterans Act The Palomares Veterans Act removes barriers to compensation for the veterans who responded to the 1966 nuclear accident in Palomares, Spain. This legislation was included in the final text of the Honoring Our Pact Act, which was signed into law on August 10, 2022. Help Find the Missing Act The Help Find the Missing Act or Billy's Law supports efforts to solve missing persons cases by closing the gaps in law enforcement databases through improved coordination across federal, state, local, and non-profit agencies. Billy's Law was inspired by Janice Smolinski of Cheshire, Connecticut, after her 31-year-old son, Billy, went missing in Waterbury, Connecticut. While working with law enforcement to locate her missing son, Smolinski was met with systemic challenges. The bill overwhelmingly passed the House in a 422-4 vote. Supporting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) Learning Opportunities Act This legislation was included in the bipartisan Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act , a comprehensive, strategic package that makes investments in American manufacturing, science, and innovation. This bill will invest in engaging learning opportunities to strengthen the pipeline of students entering the STEM workforce, especially students from underrepresented groups including women and communities of color. Federal Resources for the Fifth On December 23, 2022, Congress passed the Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) appropriations package . The legislation will help lower the cost of living for working families, create better paying jobs, and keep our nation and communities safe. I am pleased to share the legislation includes more than $23 million in community project funding for the Fifth District of Connecticut . The projects will support everything from affordable housing and community health centers to system upgrades for local fire departments and support services for law enforcement. The full list is included here: WATERBURY : $4,000,000 for renovation of Fulton Park Pool WATERTOWN : $3,375,000 for police department radio communications upgrades WATERTOWN : $3,000,000 for Main Street safety audit WATERBURY : $2,265,000 for education technology equipment, including computers for public schools NEW FAIRFIELD : $2,100,000 for the police department emergency communications system upgrade DANBURY : $2,000,000 for the Southeast, New York to Danbury, CT Rail Link environmental impact statement DANBURY : $2,000,000 for facilities and equipment at Connecticut Institute for Communities, Inc., FARMINGTON : $1,000,000 for K-12 STEM education programs at the University of Connecticut Health Center NEW BRITAIN : $1,000,000 for facilities and equipment at Klingberg Family Centers, Incorporated LITCHFIELD : $750,000 for expanding agricultural education, afterschool and behavioral health services for youth at Connecticut Junior Republic FALLS VILLAGE : $750,000 for affordable housing infrastructure at River Road Homes CHESHIRE : $625,000 for a fire protection system at Ball & Socket Arts, Inc. WATERBURY : $172,000 for expanding the Police Activity League Program NEW BRITAIN : $150,000 for training and outreach programs, services, and literacy supports for under-resourced communities at the United Way of Central and Northeastern Connecticut NEW BRITAIN : $50,000 for the childcare business incubator program This funding will be crucial in helping to respond to some of the most pressing needs in the district. Further, it builds upon the fiscal year 2022 community project funding I helped secure this Summer. I look forward to working alongside local leaders for the completion of these projects. I am excited to share all that was accomplished this term and look forward to continuing to make progress on the issues that matter most to you in the 118th Congress. As always, please continue to share your thoughts and concerns with me. It remains my honor to serve as your representative and support the people of Fifth District of Connecticut.

With the close of 2022 comes the end of the 117th Congress. The last two years have been historic as America recovered from the pandemic, reopened our economy, and defended our democracy. I'm proud of the many achievements I helped secure, including unprecedented relief funding for the child care sector, the creation of 10.5 million jobs, prescription drug cost savings for seniors, and the largest investment to tackle the climate crisis in Congressional history. As we look ahead to the new year and a new Congress, my priorities remain the same: building a more just future for every child, every worker, and every family. I thank you for your partnership, and I know that together we will continue to secure progress. Sincerely, CELEBRATING MARRIAGE EQUALITY It's official: marriage equality is now the law of the land. House Democrats sent the Respect for Marriage Act to President Biden's desk to ensure that LGBTQ+ and interracial families nationwide receive the protections they deserve. This momentous new law reaffirms our commitment to justice and opportunity for every American and moves our nation forward in its journey to becoming a more perfect union. The Respect for Marriage Act enshrines the right to equal marriage into federal law, allowing same-sex and interracial couples the same treatment as all married couples, regardless of the state in which the couple was married. There is still more work left to be done and Democrats will continue to push back against injustice and demand freedom for all. THE GREEN LINE COMES TO MEDFORD The Medford Green Line Extension is officially open! This month, I was thrilled to attend the grand opening of the Medford Green Line and celebrate the completion of the Green Line Extension. This project will deliver long overdue economic development, environmental justice, and public health benefits to communities in the Fifth District. I was proud to work alongside residents, advocates, and state and local leaders to make this moment possible. It's a game-changer for our community and shows that if we invest in public transportation, we can build a more inclusive, equitable, and accessible Commonwealth. I will continue to champion transportation improvements in Massachusetts and beyond with the heartfelt belief that public transportation is a public good. A BUDGET THAT PUTS MA-5 AND FAMILIES FIRST Just one week ago, I voted for a new federal budget that builds upon my commitment to ensuring that the government works for working Americans: Here are some key wins: $20 billion for child care and Head Start programs - the largest annual investment we've made to lower care costs for families and support early education providers. Emergency resources to support the Ukrainian people in their fight for democracy and sovereignty. Passage of my Into the Light bill, which expands mental health care services for moms, including a 24/7 voice and text hotline to improve access to screening and treatment. Expanded access to Veterans' health care, including the newly passed law to treat servicemembers exposed to toxins. Additional funding to grow our substance use disorder workforce so Americans can access the care and support they need to recover. Additionally, I was able to secure funding for 15 Community Projects in the Fifth District including funding for the Boys & Girls Club of Stoneham Child Care Facility, the Grow in Revere Food Hub and Woburn's Hurld Park Construction. For a full list of the community projects, visit my website . This funding will go a long way in strengthening our local communities and America at large, and I'm excited to these resources in action. HAPPY HOLIDAYS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE! CONGRATULATIONS, SIMON!

94," Dear Friend, As we round out 2022, and the 117th Congress, we hope you all are enjoying the holidays with your friends and family. This time of year gives us all an opportunity to reflect on all the blessings we enjoy as Americans and a chance to look back at the many accomplishments of the past year. Although Republicans were the minority party in the House of Representatives in the 117th Congress, our office still had many important accomplishments for the people of Minnesota. We authored and introduced twelve bills covering topics from fintech and agriculture to mental health and oversight of your hard-earned tax dollars. Congress is a customer service business. Throughout our time in Washington, we have made it a priority to continuously communicate with our constituents at home and were able to connect with thousands of Minnesotans providing them with important information during times of uncertainty and confusion. Our casework team in Minnesota is also working hard to help constituents struggling with federal agencies. In 2022, we assisted over 500 constituents with federal issues, and we can help you too! If you are ever experiencing issues with a federal agency, please do not hesitate to call our office in Otsego at 763-241-6848. As we look towards 2023, I look forward to hearing from you as we work to build on the successes of 2022.

96," News from Representative Wild CLICK HERE TO RECEIVE UPDATES ON MY WORK IN CONGRESS Dear Friend, As the year draws to a close and we surround ourselves with friends and family, I want to share a few of my reflections on 2022 and my goals for the upcoming year. We have made great progress toward lowering health care costs, creating jobs, and building a ""Made in America"" economy that works for everyone. I'm proud to be named among the top 12% most bipartisan members in either party-working across the aisle to invest in our communities, make our neighborhoods safer, and ensure health care professionals, students, and law enforcement have greater access to mental health tools and resources. Click to watch Rep. Wild's short Year in Review recap video This year, I was proud to deliver $18 million for local projects across the Greater Lehigh Valley, and I am eager to see these funds at work in our communities. These projects were made possible because of strong local-federal partnerships. They are testaments to the importance of constant listening and communication, so I can better understand what our communities need from Washington to make sure the federal government is working for you. After all, that's what government is supposed to do: make our lives better and our communities stronger. Click here for a map of the 15 projects I secured funding for in the Greater Lehigh Valley. Rep. Wild presents Suburban EMS with a check to continue its ""earn while you learn"" EMT training program and address the critical need for certified medical providers in the 19 municipalities it serves One of the issues that I hear about most from Pennsylvanians is the high cost of health care and prescription drugs . I have long fought to bring down health care costs, and this year we passed historic legislation to make it a reality. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare is now empowered to negotiate drug prices, out-of-pocket and insulin costs have been capped for Medicare beneficiaries, and ACA premium tax credits have been extended-all actions that will save taxpayer dollars. There are a couple other legislative accomplishments I am excited to share . The Greater Lehigh Valley has a long-standing legacy of being a manufacturing powerhouse, and I am proud to have passed my bill-the Regional Innovation Act , as part of the CHIPS and Science Act -to invest in regional technology hubs in communities like ours and create good-paying jobs. Also, our community will have better roads, safer bridges, and a better experience at Lehigh Valley International Airport thanks to investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Not only will our physical infrastructure improve, but our digital infrastructure-high-speed internet access-will be more affordable and accessible thanks to the Affordable Connectivity Program. Rep. Wild and U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg visit Lehigh Carbon Community College to announce investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that will help veterans get trained and find employment in the trucking profession Since I took office in 2018, my team of constituent advocates has worked hard to help Pennsylvanians with issues they have with the federal government. We have closed more than 11,288 constituent requests for assistance, helping them with Medicare and Social Security benefits, small business assistance, veterans benefits, passport issues and so much more. My team and I have returned more than $24,196,948 in money and benefits owed to our constituents by the federal government!

Historic Funds For South Florida's Economic, Environmental Linchpins I just helped secure $319 million to expand Port Everglades, allowing this premier commerce and passenger hub to flourish. And earlier this year, I visited the Everglades with Infrastructure Czar Mitch Landrieu to inspect how the $1.5 billion provided by President Biden's FY 2023 budget and historic Infrastructure Law will protect biodiversity, mitigate climate change, and provide clean water for millions of Floridians by restoring this environmental treasure. Two premier South Florida economic and environmental landmarks are growing stronger because of our work. Passage of Inflation Reduction Act Into Law Democrats and President Biden worked together to deliver historic legislative achievements that grow the economy from the bottom up and provide a sturdy ladder into the middle class. Specifically, the Inflation Reduction Act delivers: ⚕️ Lower healthcare costs & Rx prices ⚡ Lower energy costs and investments in clean energy 🏢 Corporate accountability 💰 Budget deficit reduction 📉 Assurance that no family making less than $400K will see taxes go up one cent Passage of the Safer Communities Act Into Law Sens. Murphy, Kelly, Klobuchar, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, and Reps. Wasserman Schultz and Carbajal gather for White House gun safety bill signing I gathered with colleagues and friends to witness President Biden sign the Safer Communities Act. This landmark legislation will save lives, and help protect our children and communities from the scourge of senseless gun violence. This was a major breakthrough on the three-decade-long chokehold that the NRA had on gun safety reforms in Congress. Still, it's vital to do more, including banning assault weapons, enacting safe storage laws, and expanding background checks. I will never stop fighting to end gun violence. Protecting and Strengthening Medicare I was honored to welcome President Biden to Broward County to share the progress Democrats made to protect and strengthen Medicare, lower prescription drug prices, and defend Social Security. Thanks to that success, here's what is on the way in 2023: ⚕️ 13M families will save $2,400 on average for health costs ⚕️ 49M Medicare enrollees will avoid prescription Rx price hikes that outpace inflation ⚕️ Medicare insulin copays will be capped at $35 per month We will always put People Over Politics to cut costs and make our communities healthier. Passage of the Respect for Marriage Act Into Law One of the first same-sex couples to marry in Florida, Todd and Jeffrey Delmay, in front of the White House with Wasserman Schultz for the Respect for Marriage Act signing I am so proud to say that love won this year! Democrats and President Biden saw the threats facing LGBTQ+ individuals and worked tirelessly to make the Respect for Marriage Act law. 🌈 I will continue to support and advocate for our LGBTQ+ communities at home and around the world. Love must always win. These are only a few victories that Democrats and President Biden delivered to our community.

98," The latest from Congresswoman Meng [image: Image]  : It's my honor to represent Queens in Congress and amplify your voice in Washington, D.C. As your Representative, I have remained focused on finding solutions to deliver a better future for our families. Just this year, we've passed much-needed funds for infrastructure, secured millions in funding for projects right here in Queens, passed commonsense gun legislation, and lowered healthcare and prescription drug costs. We've also delivered on historic investments in clean energy. My office has provided help for our constituents by helping secure Medicare, Social Security, and veterans' benefits; resolving passport, immigration, and visa issues; fighting mail theft; and more. As we look forward to the exciting year ahead, I wanted to share with you some of what I've accomplished on your behalf in 2022: - I helped pass the *Inflation Reduction Act* (IRA), which President Biden signed into law in August. *This important legislation lowers prescription drug and healthcare costs, fights climate change, and supports new jobs* by: - Finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate the price of prescription drugs and capping the price of insulin at $35 a month. No one should have to choose between buying groceries and affording their life-saving medication. - Making a historic investment in fighting climate change by promoting clean technologies manufactured here in the US and reducing carbon emissions by 40% by 2030.1 - Creates new high-paying, union jobs to support American families. - I helped pass the much-needed Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,* the first gun safety bill in decades*, which fights the gun violence epidemic by increasing access to mental health services and improving background checks to make our communities safer. I also secured $140 million for community policing solutions . - *I kept fighting to protect homes and families in our borough from increased flooding* - including calling on New York State to prioritize Queens. I secured $120 million to fix wastewater and stormwater management specifically for our borough, in addition to the billions of dollars secured for New York in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. - *I brought federal funding back to Queens to fund ten projects that will make a huge impact in our community*, including funding for local hospitals and enhancing youth development programs. You can read more about it here . - I am proud to have helped pass the Honoring Our PACT Act to support veterans and their families,* expanding healthcare benefits to over 3 million veterans* who experienced toxic substance exposure during their service to our country.2 I am honored to continue representing Queens, where I was born and raised, in Congress. I'll keep fighting for your voice in Washington, D.C. by working across the aisle and upholding my commitment to protecting families. I look forward to continuing to ensure the federal government works for Queens, and if I can ever be of assistance with a federal agency, please do not hesitate to contact my office.

99," Home About Contact Services Media Center Issues Military/ Veterans Resources December 2022 Second District Dispatch Grateful to Serve the 2nd District I will continue to work hard every day to keep Americans safe, promote good-paying jobs, and help make our lives and communities stronger. Biden Inflation Policies Affect Christmas This is a time for families across America to be joyous. However, due to irresponsible policies of Biden and Democrats, inflation reached 40-year highs this year, putting a strain on household budgets. Thanksgiving meals were particularly tough on the pocketbook, but now with the holidays here, prices continue to be unbearable - even the cost of Christmas trees rose as much as 15 percent. According to a recent survey by RetailMeNot, more than half of holiday shoppers planned to buy fewer things this year due to higher prices - and small businesses prepared for declining sales, versus last year. Our country is in a crisis. The House Republican majority will fight inflation with fiscal sanity. Constituent Organizations Meeting and speaking with those who live and work in the Second District provides me a firsthand understanding of the issues affecting the many businesses, organizations, and individuals represented. I welcome the opportunity to listen to your needs and concerns, and my offices and I stand ready to help. Whether in our Washington, Midlands, or Aiken/Barnwell offices, we want to hear from you, and our goals are to provide support however possible, whether it is an individual concern, or the issues are more broadly inclusive.

100," News from Representative Bourdeaux Dear Friends, As the year draws to a close, so does my time in Congress. I write to you today with gratitude to bid you farewell. Thank you for the honor of serving as your representative in Congress. Watch Congresswoman Bourdeaux's farewell address here. While there are many things we accomplished, perhaps the most important was simply upholding our democracy. In my first week in office, I was sworn in and then a few days later I voted to certify the election of President Joe Biden despite the former President's efforts and the efforts of an angry and violent mob to stop this process. I ran for office in part because of my deep concern that President Trump and a significant number of my colleagues in Congress would not uphold the Constitution nor abide by the norms and traditions that are critical to making our democracy function. January 6th confirmed these fears, and I am grateful for all the wonderful people who allowed me to serve during the 117th Congress so that I could be there to help uphold our democracy for one more turn of the wheel. However, I also ran for office also because we needed to strengthen our community, and I was honored to work with so many of you in Gwinnett and Forsyth to meet critical community needs. At the beginning of this Congress, our nation was in the depths of the COVID pandemic. In Georgia's 7th District, we got right to work, establishing a COVID-19 Pandemic Task Force, stocking food banks and staffing vaccine drives, and partnering with local housing nonprofits to help keep thousands of constituents in their homes. Much of this was possible thanks to the passage of the American Rescue Plan, legislation which included critical support for workers and businesses who were struggling to make ends meet. When it became clear that businesses needed more time to access the Paycheck Protection Program, set to expire in March 2021, this body came together to pass my PPP Extension Act into law, and give businesses more time to access this assistance. In Georgia alone, this helped an additional 270,000 Georgia small businesses access $5 billion in forgivable loans to keep people on the payroll and survive the COVID crisis. As the pandemic began to subside and we returned to our normal lives, my team and I held two massive jobs fairs that matched thousands in our community with local small businesses and got our local economy rolling. This Congress we passed a number of historic pieces of legislation which will help make our lives better for years to come. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is a once in a generation investment in infrastructure that will deliver more than $10.6 billion for physical infrastructure investment in Georgia over the next decade, including funding for highways, bridges, transit and rail, as well as resources for clean water, broadband, and investments in our electric grid and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Combined with the Inflation Reduction Act, these bills will make significant strides in helping our country address the challenge of climate change and will lay the foundation for the development of the green economy for the 21st Century. One of my top priorities going into Congress was addressing the high costs of healthcare and while there is still much work to do, we made some major improvements. The American Rescue Plan created and then the Inflation Reduction Act extended health insurance premium tax credits to dramatically reduce the cost of health insurance plans on the health insurance exchange ( ). On average across the country, these improvements will save families $2400 annually in health insurance costs. We also lowered the cost of prescription medications and capped the cost of insulin at $35 per month for those on Medicare. And working with members of the Georgia congressional delegation, I led the charge to protect the exchange in Georgia despite the state's concerted efforts to undermine it. Thanks to our advocacy and recent administrative actions, people in Georgia can continue to rely upon as their one stop shop for health insurance. Of course, there is still progress to be made to ensure affordable, quality health care for everyone, including by closing the Medicaid coverage gap. I worked with Senator Rev. Warnock to lead the Medicaid Saves Lives Act, which would create a federal work-around to fully expand Medicaid in states that have failed to take action. Finally, working with many key organizations across the community, I was able to deliver almost $18 million for 24 targeted community projects. These all represented key investments in areas of need in our community and included: Investment in Early Childhood Education and After School Programs: All of us know the importance of investing in the next generation through early childhood education. While I would love to see universal pre-K, we made some important steps to securing funding for key programs in our community in this area. We secured $775,000 for the Building Babies Brains program to help parents ensure their children start school ready to learn. Because of the federal funding which was matched by the Gwinnett Schools' Foundation, every elementary school in Gwinnett will have access to this early childhood education program. We secured $750,000 for a similar program, Spark! Ignite Learning, Birth and Beyond to support a similar effort in Forsyth county. In Fy2023 we secured $400,000 for the Boys and Girls Club of Metro Atlanta to help with long term learning loss and strengthen children's foundation for learning and $250,000 to help Corners Outreach help with after school and summer programs for at-risk Hispanic youth. Investment in Mental Health Treatment and Diagnosis: After COVID, all of us were increasingly aware of mental health issues in our community and the need to make significant investments to improve the services being offered. Through my office, we secured $235,000 for the Forsyth County Sheriff's Crisis Intervention Teams to help law enforcement respond more effectively to mental health crises and $90,000 to support Forsyth County's Insight Program to help at-risk young people. In this year's appropriations bills we secured $900,000 for Gwinnett's Viewpoint Health Crisis Walk-in Center and $462,000 for Ser Familia's Center for Family and Emotional Support for immigrant children who may have experienced trauma. Investment in Veteran's Services: I will always support our veterans, and this Congress we passed many notable pieces of legislation to help improve veterans services including the PACT Act that will ensure veterans exposed to toxic substances during the course of their service receive the health benefits and support they need. However, specific to our community, in the FY2022 legislation, I secured $720,000 for a nationally recognized organization, Hire Heroes USA, which helps with job placement for our veterans. And in FY2023 we secured $1.28 million in funding for AboutFace-USA to provide comprehensive veteran care and support services. Investment in Innovation and Small Businesses: We have a vibrant small business community, in part powered by our immigrant communities. An area of need we identified was small business support for our immigrant communities so we secured $100,000 for our Small Business Development Center to help provide more in-language services. Additionally, I am committed to helping foster innovation. We have several areas to promote in this space including supporting $310,000 for the Water Tower to promote innovation in water research and technology and $495,000 to Curiosity Lab to support innovation in autonomous vehicle technology. Investment in Black History and Community Reconciliation: A theme during my time in Congress has been ensuring that our community remembers and honors our Black history and works towards reconciliation so that we move forward together as one community. In addition to introducing legislation to recognize the Forsyth County racial cleansing that occurred in the early 1900s, I was so pleased to be able to secure funding $500,000 for the African American library and archival collection at the Hooper Renwick Memorial Library. We also worked with local governments and non-profits to secure millions for key investments in water infrastructure in south Gwinnett, bus stops, workforce development, affordable housing, and support for families with babies and for victims of sexual abuse. I want to end with this: for those who are cynical about our politics, who believe that it is all about corruption, money, and power (and yes there is a lot of that, of course), please know that you are surrounded by so many people of integrity, courage and talent - in both parties and in many different roles - who care deeply about our community, our state, and our country. It has been my honor to work with so many of you, and I know the work that we have done together will continue on and will be in good hands. Thank you again for the honor of representing our community in Congress. Sincerely, Carolyn Bourdeaux Member of Congress   Open in browser Open plain text version ",Bourdeaux

Renaming the Schaumburg Post Office in Honor of Veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars This week, President Joe Biden signed into law my bipartisan legislation, H.R. 6386, which renames the Schaumburg Post Office, located at 450 West Schaumburg Road, as the 'Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan Memorial Post Office Building.' The debt that we owe the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to serve our country can never fully be repaid, but it is my hope that when members of our community visit the Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan Memorial Post Office, the only post office in the nation named after veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, they will be reminded of the debt of gratitude we all owe the heroes of our nation's most recent conflicts. I am grateful to my colleagues in the House and the Senate for joining me in helping honor these heroes by passing this legislation. Please stay tuned to future newsletters and my social media channels for an announcement regarding an official renaming ceremony at the post office in the new year. Wishing You a Happy and Healthy New Year in 2023 As we prepare to step into 2023, it's good to take a step back and reflect on all that we have accomplished together in the past year. 2022 was a year filled with so many joyous occasions and moments of progress, as well as periods of adversity that brought us together more as a community. As we recover from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, I'm encouraged by the renewed sense of community that I have seen and felt in so many parts of our district this year, and I look forward to seeing that growth continue in 2023. Throughout my conversations with many of you this year, I was struck by the energy and enthusiasm that so many of you have for working towards a better future not only for our district, but our country as a whole. It fills me with an unbridled optimism and hope for what we can accomplish in the year to come.

104," Friends, As another year comes to a close and the 117th Congress adjourns sine die, I am reflective of my time and grateful to have served you and the Second District of Arkansas during the 117th Congress. This year, my team and I were proud to provide services for central Arkansans and continue to work on behalf of veterans in our communities, ensuring their needs are addressed and they have access to the resources and benefits provided to them. I look forward to House Republicans assuming the House majority in January, providing an opportunity to address our nation's most pressing issues. I will continue to fight hard to lower inflation and strengthen our economy, protect our communities, secure our southwest border, support our brave police officers, and make the concerns of all central Arkansans heard in Washington. It is an honor to represent you in the Second District of Arkansas - if you or someone you know needs assistance with a federal agency, is planning a visit to Washington, D.C., or wants to voice an opinion, please contact my office by calling (501) 324-5941 or visiting my website at . My staff and I stand ready to serve you. I wish each and every one of you a Happy New Year filled with hope and opportunities and look forward to continuing to represent you in the 118th Congress. PRIORITIZING OUR VETERANS Last week, I had the pleasure of joining Brian Gawne, Vice President of Operations at Fisher House Foundation, at the Rotary Club of Little Rock. Together, we discussed the importance of the Fisher House Organization and the services it offers for veterans. Since first visiting a Fisher House at Walter Reed Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, I have advocated for bringing a Fisher House to the Little Rock VA. A Fisher House provides families with the opportunity to stay together by providing accommodations free of cost, as veterans face illness and injury. A site in Little Rock is now on Fisher's planning roster. The veteran community is a top priority for me, and I will continue to advocate on behalf of all veterans in central Arkansas. To learn more about the Fisher House Foundation, please click HERE . A NEW TRAILHEAD I recently celebrated the opening of the Blue Mountain Natural Area with Governor Asa Hutchinson and Secretary Stacy Hurst of the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism. The new trailhead at Blue Mountain Natural Area will continue to develop the hiking, climbing, and biking opportunities all the way from Fort Roots to Flatside Wilderness in the Ouachita National Forest. Blue Mountain also will help ensure the protection of water quality for over half a million Arkansans. Thanks to the conservation work of the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism and The Nature Conservancy. I am excited for this new trailhead and look forward to seeing what's next for our area! WELCOMING UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT ZELENSKY Last week, I had the honor of being a part of the Escort Committee for the Joint Meeting of the House and Senate to welcome Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the U.S. Capitol. President Zelensky addressed Congress regarding the current state of Ukraine and their efforts to eject Putin's army and free its people of Russia's brutal and illegal invasion of their sovereign nation. He thanked the U.S. for our continued financial, military, and humanitarian aid. I joined David Westin on Bloomberg Balance of Power last week to discuss President Zelensky's visit. My full interview can be viewed by clicking HERE . KEEPING YOUR FAMILY HEALTHY RSV and the flu are on the rise across Arkansas. It can be easy to mix up RSV, the flu, COVID, and a common cold due to their shared symptoms. Below is a guideline outlining the major symptoms for each of these, as well as who is most at risk if infected. I encourage you to contact your doctor with any questions you may have, as well as reach out about what you can do to keep you and your family healthy this holiday season.

105," Friend, Serving Iowans in Congress has been the greatest honor of my life. Watch my video recapping my first term working for you HERE. I came to Congress to stand up for working families, ensure our farmers and rural America had a seat at the table, and to keep our communities safe. Together, we've delivered on these goals, and more. Accessibility and transparency are the cornerstone of this job - you can't do it right unless you're out in the community and with Iowans in their daily lives. That's why I've held an in-person, open press town hall in all 20 counties of the First District, as well as 14 virtual town halls to connect with Iowans - marking 34 town halls total. While we don't always agree on every issue, I'm always going to get your perspective and explain where I stand. We visited all twenty counties in the district eight times - we've visited family farms, child care centers, and walked down our Main Streets. We've toured manufacturing shop floors, innovative flood mitigation projects, and health care facilities. I want to thank everyone who has shared their stories with me over the past two years. I've introduced 28 pieces of legislation to address the issues most important to Iowans, including: The Informed Lawmaking to Combat Inflation Act, to rein in wasteful government spending and bring costs down; The Stop the Betrayal Act to stop the flow of illegal immigration at our Southern Border; The Providing for Life Act, to support new families and expand the Child Tax Credit; and the Child Care Block Development Grant Reauthorization Act to expand affordable child care access. I also introduced the PRECISE Act, legislation to empower farmers with conservation tools, and helped pass this important bill out of the House. I was proud to work with our entire Iowa delegation to get the bipartisan Sergeant Brandon Ketchum Rural Veterans Mental Health Act signed into law to ensure veterans in rural areas can receive mental health care. As the only Iowan on the House Appropriations Committee, I've watched your tax dollars like a hawk, standing against wasteful spending while working to bring resources back home. We secured over $53 million for local projects, including for a child care center in Winneshiek County, to advance construction on Tower Terrace Road in Linn County, to complete a fire station in Howard County, and to upgrade our lock and dam system along the Upper Mississippi River. My team and I closed over 3,500 constituent cases - helping Iowans recover lost Social Security benefits, deal with the IRS, secure visas and passports to reunite with family, and ensure veterans are getting the care they deserve at the VA. We've corresponded with constituents approximately 60,000 times - answering your questions and addressing your concerns. We look forward to continuing these conversations in the new year! We advocated fiercely for our priorities, securing Dubuque's status as a metropolitan area, and making sure our communities received resources for derecho recovery, and stood up for values: demanding the Biden Administration secure our border, protecting the rights of parents, and defending the Second Amendment. I will continue to be an unwavering check on the Biden Administration, while finding ground to deliver on the priorities that matter most to Iowa families, farmers, small businesses, and veterans. The taxpayers of Iowa are my only bosses, and for me, Iowa will always come first. I'm proud of what we've been able to accomplish together in a short time, and look forward to building on these successes in the new Congress.

106," News From Congressman Ben Cline Sixth District Perspectives with Congressman Ben Cline While the streets of America are filled with holiday cheer, business-as-usual Washington, D.C., is not. As the clock ran out on government funding and Democrats' House majority, Congress was desperately trying to keep the lights on because one-party rule failed to do their most basic duty-govern. Rather than address the needs and will of the American people, the Lame Duck Democrats released a 4,155 page Far Left wish list in the dead of night with a nearly $2 TRILLION price tag for the American people and future generations to pay off. Democrats effectively overturned the people's will of voting for a Republican majority in the coming Congress by locking in their spending priorities for the next year. Rest assured, in the new majority, House Republicans will move to restore spending sanity and follow the time-tested rule of actually passing a budget in the time that the law requires. In a touch of good news, however, the IRS acquiesced to the demands of my colleagues and myself that they delay the intrusive measure of bombarding Americans with 1099-K forms for every $600 and above payment they make on Venmo and similar platforms. We will work to abolish that provision for good come next year. The year has had many challenges, yet Christmas and the coming new year offer the chance to celebrate the blessing of the birth of Jesus Christ and the promise of renewal in the coming year. From my family to yours, we wish you a blessed holiday season and time with friends and family. Taxpayers Get Coal as Democrats Give the Gift of Inflation and Debt In a final touch to the sad and destructive legacy of Speaker Pelosi's House of Representatives, Democrat-controlled Congress rammed through a massive $1.7 trillion spending package and did so right on the cusp of Christmas, just as holiday shoppers are still dealing with rising prices and energy bills, and the Nation is facing over $31 trillion in debt. Democrats' bloated omnibus spending spree represents exactly what's wrong with Washington: a 4,000+ page, over $1.7 trillion government funding deal negotiated in secret that we were forced to vote on at the last minute. Furthermore, just look at some of the egregious provisions my colleagues and I found in this bill: -$3.2 billion to continue processing and releasing illegal migrants at a faster pace and larger scale, encouraging more chaos at our border -$335 million to prepare for an influenza pandemic, including the use of surveillance tools to fund a health federal police state -$410 million to ""remain available"" to reimburse Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia and Oman for ""enhanced border security."" At least $150 million of that must go to Jordan, according to the bill, while at the same time the bill insufficiently funds our own border security in the face of the worst open border crisis in the history of America. -$2.3 million to the Department of Education to encourage student loan holders to enroll in the Biden administration's unconstitutional student loan bailout scheme -It fails to promote American domestic energy production by allocating $370 billion in Green New Deal style handouts to ""green"" industries and Democrat donors -The bill also gives the IRS over $12.3 billion more of Americans' tax dollars, on top of the $80 billion Democrats already allocated to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to spy on Americans' bank accounts and go after their hard-earned money In the end, with over 4,000 pages and just 72 hours to read it, this bill makes it impossible to know the total cost that will fall on the backs of American taxpayers - and worsens inflation that's devastating working families. Americans have to live within their means, while Congress spends into oblivion with money we don't have. It's pure Washington dysfunction in action, and it must be stopped. That's why I voted against this bill, because the American people who elected us deserve a Congress that spends responsibly, not more than we can afford. To read my full statement on the bill's passing, click here . Rest assured, come January, Republicans will start governing and offering solutions to the multiple crises facing our Nation. We will confront an open border, out-of-control spending that's resulting in near 40-year high inflation, a surge in crime across America, and conduct rigorous oversight of Biden's federal bureaucracy that has waged war on Americans' freedoms. The IRS Acquiesces to House Republicans' Demands In a touch of good news, however, you may recall that l ast month I joined my colleagues in sending a letter, which can be found here , demanding the IRS delay the intrusive measure of bombarding Americans with 1099-K forms for every $600 and above payment they make on Venmo and similar platforms. I am glad the IRS finally listened to us and is set to delay that provision for a year. But with Republicans in the majority come January, we will work to make sure that specific provision is abolished for good and that the IRS gets off our backs. Life Outside of Washington: A Very Merry Christmas to You and Yours Despite the challenges America faces at home and in the world abroad, the Good News is among us. Truly, Joy to the World this Christmas season! While all the children of the Sixth District are hoping to stay off Santa's naughty list this year, let us remember the true meaning of Christmas.

107," Click here to receive my Newsletter ABOUT GT CONTACT ISSUES MEDIA CENTER SERVICES Dear Friends, As I work on your behalf in Washington, D.C., my mission is to advocate for Pennsylvania's priorities at the highest levels of government. I am sharing with you the Good, the Bad, and the Local for what's happening in Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District. If you or someone you know needs assistance with a federal agency - like the VA, IRS, or Social Security, my office is ready to help. Please reach out to us at 202-225-5121, or visit - and let us help you or your loved one this holiday season. It is my honor to represent you - I wish you a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! God bless. Sincerely, Rep. Glenn ""GT"" Thompson The Good SUPPORTING NATIONAL HERITAGE AREAS: I supported S. 1942, the National Heritage Area Act , last week, which establishes a National Heritage Area (NHA) System to standardize the process for studying and establishing new National Heritage Areas. The bill will also reduce bureaucratic complexity and uncertainty by ending the current piecemeal reauthorization process for NHAs by creating a single 15-year authorization. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the House companion bill, H.R. 1316. PA-15's Oil Region was federally designated a National Heritage Area in 1994, which encompasses northwestern Pennsylvania. The Oil Region commemorates and promotes the region surrounding Edwin Drake's oil well of 1859 near Titusville, which gave rise to the modern oil industry. NHA's contribute to commercial activities and employment as well as regional regeneration, skills development, and citizens' cultural participation. HELPING NEIGHBORS IN NEED: As Chairman-Elect of the House Committee on Agriculture, I was proud to support S. 5329, the Food Donation Improvement Act of 2021, which expands food donation efforts across the country. While millions of Americans are facing food insecurity, ambiguous, outdated, and limited liability protections often prevent many businesses and organizations from donating food. Specifically, the bill encourages food donation efforts by extending liability protections to food donors when food is either given directly to a person in need or when a recipient pays a deeply reduced cost. THOMPSON CHRONIC WASTING (CWD) BILL PASSES CONGRESS: H.R. 5608, the Chronic Wasting Disease Research and Management Act, was approved by Congress advancing much-needed solutions for curbing the spread of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD). CWD is a contagious neurological disease affecting cervids - deer, elk, and moose - that is always fatal and there is no known cure. CWD has been confirmed in 29 states, including Pennsylvania, and there are serious concerns the disease will continue to spread to herds across the country. I was proud to introduce H.R. 5608, which provides significant funding research into CWD prevention and supports state and tribal efforts to develop and implement management strategies for the disease. The legislation now awaits the president's signature. INNOVATION CONSERVATION SOLUTIONS : The SUSATINS Act, which I introduced, was approved by Congress last week. The SUSTAINS Act, which is widely praised by the agriculture industry, including support from the American Farm Bureau, encourages private-sector partnerships for agriculture sustainability by allowing businesses to invest in conservation practices in geographic regions of their choice. This innovative climate solution empowers the original stewards of our land-our farmers, ranchers, and foresters. This thoughtful, science-based policy will help promote a stronger agriculture economy by leveraging private sector support to grow climate-friendly innovations that are already being carried out by producers. We cannot sacrifice a healthy economy for a healthy environment, and vice versa. The Bad NEW LOW POINT: For the first time in United States history, a bill in the House of Representatives was passed without a physical quorum present - meaning more people voted from home than in the House Chamber. Aside from the trillions of dollars in spending that we do not have and the Democrats' decision to only negotiate behind closed doors, the omnibus legislation contains many provisions that will damage our country. Republicans will end proxy voting and restore fiscal responsibility. OTHER BORDERS MATTER: The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 , or more commonly referred to the ""omnibus bill,"" is a 4,155-page spending package designating federal funds for a laundry list of agencies, projects, and government functions. In total, the bill designates $410 million dollars for ""enhanced border security"" in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia, and Oman. Specifically, Jordan is guaranteed at least $150 million from the total allocation. This same legislation expressly prohibits U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) funding from being used to improve United States border security. November 2022 was the WORST November in CBP's history with more than 200,000 illegal crossings of our southern border for the ninth consecutive month. FAILED LEADERSHIP ON JANUARY 6TH 2021: House Republicans issued a Report of Investigation on the Security Failures at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, which outlines a failure of leadership by Speaker Pelosi and House Democrat Leadership to protect the Capitol on January 6, 2021. It is clear they were more concerned with optics rather than ensuring the safety of Members, staff, and our brave Capitol Police. Some of the key findings included: The Speaker of the House and Democrat leadership were closely involved in security decisions in the lead up to and on January 6, 2021. The House Sergeant at Arms took direction from staff in the Office of the Speaker of the House and intentionally excluded Republicans from key meetings and conversations related to House security. Widespread concern from Democrat Leadership over ""optics"" in the aftermath of summer 2020 ""Black Lives Matter"" protests prevented early deployment of the National Guard. The Local FLY HIGH EAGLE: I was honored to speak at the Eagle Court of Honor for Nate Parker last week. Nate earned his Eagle Scout Award as a member of Beech Creek Scout Troop 54. As the Chair of the House Congressional Scouting Caucus, and an Eagle Scout myself, I appreciated the invitation to attend this special event. Once an Eagle Scout, always an Eagle Scout. REMEMBERING FRANCO HARRIS: For the past week, the Nittany Lion and Steeler nations have mourned the loss of Hall of Fame Pittsburgh Steelers and Nittany Lion running back, Franco Harris, who died at the age of 72. After having a highly successful career at Penn State, Harris played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Pittsburgh Steelers. He is best known for one of the most famous plays in NFL history, the Immaculate Reception. This play occurred on December 23, 1972 when the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Oakland Raiders faced off in the AFC divisional playoff game at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh. With the Steelers trailing 7-6, on fourth down with 22 seconds left in the game, Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw threw a pass targeting John Fuqua. The pass bounced off the helmet of Raiders safety Jack Tatum and Franco Harris caught it just before it hit the ground and ran for a game-winning touchdown. Franco left his mark on and off the field. He was also a champion for Special Olympics Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh Promise nonprofit. May he rest in peace. * Click here to   from future communications ",Thompson

From the roads we drive on to the goods we buy at the store, it all depends on our nation's infrastructure. But this year, it got even more personal for folks on the Treasure Coast. In order to accommodate the Brightline rail expansion, the U.S. Coast Guard is considering a change to the regulations of the St. Lucie River railroad bridge, and the proposal could seriously impede the access of boaters in our community.

Read on to learn more: MILLIONS IN FUNDING SECURED FOR CENTRAL COAST PROJECTS As the Central Coast's Representative, my first and foremost responsibility is to deliver real results for our communities and its residents. That's why I am proud to share that just a few days ago, I successfully delivered over $22 million to help fund 14 local projects across our communities that will enhance our roads and highways, renovate our public spaces, and improve the quality of life here on the Central Coast.

WINS FOR FIREFIGHTERS, PUBLIC SAFETY In the closing days of this busy year, I was able to get two different bills that I wrote to the President's desk to become law! The Federal Firefighters Fairness Act , which ensures that federal firefighters receive the same access to health and retirement benefits as state and local firefighters. Federal firefighters have fought tirelessly on the frontlines of California's wildfires, and I'm glad they will finally receive the benefits they deserve. The S mall Passenger Vessel Liability Fairness Act , which makes crucial changes to a decades old law that prevents maritime accident victims and their families from receiving compensation from those responsible for the accident. I've worked on this bill with the families of the victims of the tragic Conception boat fire in 2019, and I'm glad it has finally become law. WHAT A YEAR! As this two-year Congress comes to a close, I'm happy to reflect on what was one of the most productive legislative sessions in recent history - and all that I got signed into law that will continue delivering for the Central Coast for years to come. Check out my last video of the year, ""24 Wins for California's 24th District"", to get a recap of everything that happened in 2022.

111," Counting down top accomplishments over a decade of service Dear friend, The Congressional District I serve is home to the Rock Island Arsenal in the Quad-Cities, the Peoria Air National Guard base and major aerospace companies in Rockford that employ thousands of people across our region. In our part of Illinois, a strong military means a strong community. During the last decade, I've delivered for each of these areas. I helped establish the Center of Excellence for Advanced and Additive Manufacturing at the Rock Island Arsenal , secured $110 million for the Arsenal Sustainment Initiative , fought to secure $7.8 million for a new Fire Crash Rescue Station at the Peoria Air National Guard Base and through my role on the House Appropriations Committee, directed millions of dollars to strengthen our military and communities. I've also made sure that military personnel who bravely served our nation have been honored in our communities. During my time in Congress, I dedicated four Post Offices to members of our military who made the ultimate sacrifice: Sgt. Douglas Riney , Lance Cpl. Jordan Bastean , Cpt. Joshua Steele and Senior Airman Daniel Miller . The families of our fallen heroes have sacrificed so much for our country, and when Gold Star Spouse Kylie Riney came to me for help, I knew we needed to act. After the loss of her husband, Mrs. Riney was stuck in a lease, thousands of miles away from her family. She wanted to bring her two young children home to Illinois and grieve the loss of her husband, but faced steep penalty fees from a landlord who refused to let her break the rental agreement. So, I worked to make sure no military family would ever endure this type of hardship again. My Gold Star Spouses Leasing Relief Act was signed into law that year, and later the House of Representatives passed a bill extending these protections to include automobile leases . We depend on our service members, and they need to know they can depend on us. That's why I've always been proud to work to honor our nation's commitment to our heroes.

113," Sen. Rick Scott is Fighting for Freedom Across the Globe this Human Rights Month ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ In Case You Missed It! Sen. Rick Scott is Fighting for Freedom Across the Globe this Human Rights Month Sen. Rick Scott: Actions Speak Louder Than Words, Democrats Must Stop Appeasing Communist Cuban Regime Senator Rick Scott continued his calls for the oppressive, illegitimate Castro/Díaz-Canel regime to finally release the Cuban freedom activists its holding as political prisoners and subjecting to mistreatment and violence. Last week, following more than a year of urging from Senator Scott, President Joe Biden finally issued a statement calling for the immediate release of all political prisoners who have been held since the July 11th protests. Immediately after this statement was released, Senator Scott received alarming reports that José Daniel Ferrer was beaten in front of his family during their recent visit with him. Following these horrific actions by the regime's thugs, Senator Scott again reached out and spoke to Archdiocese of Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski, Organization of American States (OAS) Secretary General Luis Almagro and the United Nations (UN) Secretary General António Guterres to urge coordinated calls for the release of all political prisoners and condemnation of the Cuban regime's human rights crimes and brutal oppression. Senator Rick Scott said, ""What the oppressive, illegitimate Castro/Díaz-Canel regime is doing to the freedom-loving people of Cuba is disgusting. Yet Joe Biden and Congressional Democrats continue to give the regime the validation it wants with appeasement and gross photo ops that help it hide the brutal oppression its forcing on the Cuban people. Recently, we learned that Díaz-Canel's thugs beat freedom activists José Daniel Ferrer in front of his wife, daughter and young son. These thugs beat a husband and father in front of his family, in front of his children - and just days before, Democrat members of Congress traveled there to shake hands and smile for photos. THIS APPEASEMENT IS WEAK, DISGUSTING, ENABLING THE TORTURE OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND IT MUST END NOW. The Biden administration must stand with us and match its words with actions and stop its weak appeasement of the illegitimate regime. The freedom-loving people of Cuba and the wrongfully imprisoned July 11th protestors depend on this. If the Biden administration truly supports a new day of freedom for Cuba, actions to support the Cuban people, like supplying internet and reinstating sanctions, must be taken to denounce this brutal action and condemn the Cuban Communist regime."" Read more HERE . At the Urging of Sen. Rick Scott, Biden Finally Calls for Cuban Prisoners to be Released Following more than a year of urging from Senator Rick Scott to stand with the brave Cuban people and denounce the oppressive, illegitimate, communist regime in Cuba, President Joe Biden issued a statement calling for the immediate release of all political prisoners who have been held since the July 11th protests. Senator Rick Scott said, ""For decades, the illegitimate, communist Cuban regime has oppressed the Cuban people and forced them to live under tyranny. The Cuban people want freedom, and on July 11, 2021, democracy activists from across the island organized, and with one voiced shouted, '¡Patria y Vida!' and '¡Libertad!' Since then, the regime has held and tortured hundreds of peaceful Cubans, including teenage boys and girls. I've spent more than a year calling on President Biden to join me in denouncing the regime and denying the expedited consideration of his nominees until he called for the immediate release of these brave people, and I am proud to see that finally happen today. But, this is not the end of our fight. I expect President Biden to continue to be a voice for freedom and democracy in Latin America, and end his appeasement of the regimes in Cuba and Venezuela. The Cuban people want a new day of freedom, and we will fight alongside them until that day is here."" Read more HERE . Sen. Rick Scott Sends Warning to CCP Against Violent Crackdown on Protesters Senator Rick Scott joined a bipartisan group of 42 senators in a letter to the Chinese ambassador to the United States warning the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) of the consequences of a violent crackdown on peaceful protesters. Demonstrations have erupted across China in response to the CCP's severe measures restricting freedoms to contain rising COVID-19 infections. Read the full letter HERE . Sen. Rick Scott Urges Biden to Cease Nuclear Deal Negotiations with Iranian Regime As demonstrators in Iran continue to peacefully oppose the Iranian regime, Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to announce that negotiations for a nuclear deal will not move forward at any time during his administration. Read the full letter HERE . Sen. Rick Scott Demands Answers After Biden Admin Gives Taxpayer-Funded Intellectual Property to Communist China Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science Director Asmeret Asefaw Berhe and Under Secretary for Science and Innovation Geraldine Richmond demanding answers after alarming reports that the DOE allowed an innovative battery technology, developed using millions of American taxpayer dollars, to be transferred to a Chinese company. Even more troubling, DOE reportedly allowed this license transfer to a Communist Chinese company while several American companies have been unable to receive authorization from the agency to manufacture the batteries domestically. Read the full letters HERE and HERE . Sen. Rick Scott to Guatemalan President Giammattei: Thank You for Standing for Freedom and Democracy in Venezuela Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after a call with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei. During their call, Senator Scott and President Giammattei discussed the shared commitment between the United States and Guatemala to support democracy and freedom in Latin America. Last week, during the 52nd General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS) held in Lima, Peru, Guatemala was one of the few countries that voted against a motion to remove the envoy of Juan Guaidó, the democratically-elected leader of Venezuela, from the Regional Forum for Political and Economic Issues. Senator Rick Scott said, ""It was great to speak with President Giammattei today and thank him for standing up for the legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó, and against the brutally oppressive Maduro dictatorship. The leaders of freedom-loving countries across the world must unite and work together in defense of human rights, freedom and democracy and stand with the people of Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua that are being oppressed and are suffering at the hands of Castro, Díaz-Canel, Maduro and Ortega. It is incredibly disappointing to see so many members of the OAS fail to stand for democratic values and the oppressed Venezuelan people. I am grateful that the government of Guatemala showed courage and its commitment to freedom in supporting Juan Guaidó, and I look forward to continuing to work with President Giammattei to support democracy throughout Latin America.""

Rick Scott: Xi's Power Grab Exposes Communist China's Desire for World Domination Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following Xi Jinping's address to the Chinese Communist Party's 20th National Congress and ahead of Xi's re-election to a third term as the President of Communist China later this week. Senator Rick Scott said, ""Xi Jinping's re-election is a sham and the entire world knows it. Democracy does not exist in Communist China and his rhetoric concerning a forceful takeover of Taiwan, while unsurprising, cannot be ignored. General Secretary Xi does not want peace and under his leadership, the Chinese Communist Party has chosen to be America's enemy. We must recognize that above all, Xi wants conformity and submission from every nation and every people, from the oppressed Uyghurs in Xinjiang, to the self-governing people of Taiwan and Hong Kong, to global superpowers including the United States. We must resolutely reject his tyranny and take action NOW to isolate Communist China by decoupling all American business from this dangerous regime and re-shoring, near-shoring, and friend-shoring our supply chains. Significant investments in naval, air power and cybersecurity, along with strengthened economic and military partnerships with India, Japan, South Korea and Australia are vital to containing Xi and protecting our security and economic interests in the Indo-Pacific. I urge President Biden to immediately support these necessary actions and make clear to the world that the United States will never bow to Communist China's evil."" Read more HERE . Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Unanimous Senate Passage of Bipartisan, Bicameral BOLIVAR Act; Calls for House Passage the Senate unanimously passed Senator Rick Scott's Banning Operations and Leases with the Illegitimate Venezuelan Authoritarian Regime (BOLIVAR) Act . The legislation would prohibit federal agencies from doing business with anyone that supports the oppressive Maduro regime. The bill had unanimously passed the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in March 2021. The BOLIVAR Act is co-sponsored by Senators Jacky Rosen, Marco Rubio and Thom Tillis. Congressman Michael Waltz and Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz are leading the companion bipartisan bill in the House of Representatives. In 2019, Senator Scott's amendment to cut off funds to the Maduro regime was included in the National Defense Authorization Act and Senator Scott signed similar legislation into law as Governor of Florida. Senator Rick Scott said, ""We all know what Nicolás Maduro is doing in Venezuela. He's starving his own citizens. He's imprisoning his political enemies. He's providing a foothold to Russia, Iran, Communist China and Hezbollah and is actively destabilizing our hemisphere. There is no reason the U.S. government should be working with companies that also work with such a gross dictator. I'm incredibly proud that the Senate voted to hold Maduro accountable for his abuses by unanimously passing my BOLIVAR Act. As we work to weaken Maduro's position in the Western Hemisphere, and oppose our enemies, such as Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, who support Maduro, this bill is a huge step forward and a big win for America's security. The passage of the BOLIVAR Act exemplifies the commitment of the American people to being tough with our enemies when they threaten America's national security. I'd like to thank my colleagues in the Senate and Representative Waltz for leading this effort in the House-we can and should pass this important bill into law NOW."" The BOLIVAR Act : Prohibits federal agencies from awarding U.S. government contracts with companies that are engaged in business with the Maduro regime. The prohibition would only apply to contracts entered into on or after the bill's enactment and would not affect any business with the legitimate elected government of the National Assembly and its elected successors. Provides for necessary exceptions, including for rendering humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and when the Office of Foreign Assets Control issues a valid license to do business in Venezuela. Allows the Secretary of State to waive the restriction when in the national interest of the U.S. Read more HERE . TALLAHASSEE 111 N.

115," Hey folks, Last week the Senate passed the annual federal budget bill, and I know we already told you about all the great Colorado community projects that got included! But that barely scratches the surface. This year's funding bill truly has 'Colorado' written all over it, and we're so excited that tons of legislation WE came up with has been included. Check them out: Dearfield Study Act - legislation that would direct the Department of the Interior to study the Dearfield Homestead in Weld County - once the largest Black homestead in Colorado - to determine whether it should be protected as part of the National Park System. Colorado River Basin Conservation Act - a bipartisan bill to renew the System Conservation Pilot Program, which pays people who use the Colorado River water to voluntarily conserve water. It's an important step to help save the Colorado River! Upper Colorado and San Juan River Basins Recovery Act - another bipartisan bill to continue protecting four threatened and endangered native fish species in the Upper Colorado and San Juan River Basins. Modernizing Biosurveillance and Epidemic Forecasting Act - a - you guessed it - bipartisan bill to modernize surveillance and forecasting of pandemic-causing viruses, so we can stop the next pandemic before it starts. Simplifying Small Business Retirement Savings Act - one more bipartisan bill to make it easier and lower costs for small businesses that offer retirement plans for their employees. Incentivizing Small Business Retirement Savings Act - a bill that gives a tax credit to small business owners to offset the costs of setting up a retirement plan. We're protecting our rivers, preserving our history, lowering prescription drug costs, and helping small business employees save for retirement. This is what a productive Congress looks like. Cheers!

116," DECEMBER NEWSLETTER Dear   , Wishing you and your families a safe and happy holiday season. While our respective traditions may be different, we are united by the gratitude and hope this season brings. Our accomplishments this year give me hope for even brighter days ahead. Just this month, I proudly cast my vote to protect the right to love who you want, how you want. We passed the Respect for Marriage Act to prevent states from denying LGBTQI+ and interracial couples the right to marry. I secured a better, safer future with my co-conspirators for justice in the ﻿White House (President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, left) and in Congress (Congressman Chuy Garcia and Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia, right). Securing marriage equality wasn't our only historic success this year. We enacted the first major gun safety policy passed by Congress in nearly 30 years . We're creating good-paying jobs and keeping our supply chain strong through the CHIPS and Science Act, and we've made historic reductions in health care costs . And we elected Congressman Hakeem Jeffries to lead us into the 118th Congress as the first Black party leader in Congressional history. Now, while the year winds down, we're fighting to the finish to deliver for the people. This week, we passed the FY23 Omnibus Spending Bill, which included $22.6 million in funding that I secured for 15 community projects across the Fighting Fifth. From honoring our civil rights legacy, to strengthening our infrastructure, to investing in our HBCUs, these funds will change lives from corner to corner of our District. One of the most important parts of this job is being an advocate for you and bringing resources to your doorstep will always be a top priority. As always, we are here to help.

Bilingual volunteers are particularly needed. To learn more about these programs and apply as a volunteer visit . Vaccine Finder Flu season is in full swing and there are new COVID-19 variants. The best way to protect yourself from catching either is with vaccines. At , you can find the latest information on who needs which vaccine or booster and most importantly: where to get the shots you need. Deferred 2020 Social Security Taxes Due If you are an employer or self-employed individual that chose to defer paying part of your 2020 Social Security tax liability, your second annual installment of the deferred amount is due on Dec. 31. More information is available on the IRS' website . SIGNED BY PRESIDENT BIDEN Max Cleland VA Medical Center Act President Biden signed my legislation to rename Atlanta's Veterans Affairs Medical Center after Senator Max Cleland. Senator Cleland, who served in Vietnam before becoming a U.S. Senator, was a true stateman and hero to Georgians. I'm proud to have worked with our Georgia Senators to honor a man who represented the best of Georgia. INTRODUCED Equity in STD Testing Act Access to testing for sexually transmitted diseases and infections should never depend on your insurance status or how much money is in your bank account. My Equity in STD Testing Act will ensure that everyone can access STD testing. This is one step toward creating a more just and equitable healthcare system and I'll keep fighting to bring everyone access to essential healthcare. Election Mail Act In November, the American people stood up loud and clear in defense of democracy. It's my duty in Congress to listen to the people and take common-sense action to modernize and protect our elections. My Election Mail Act will make sure our vote-by-mail systems work for every voter by getting ballots to (and from) voters on time, allowing voters to track their ballots through the mail, and more! People Over Long Lines Act Just as with voters who vote by mail, voters who cast their ballots in person should be able to make their voice heard quickly and efficiently. The People Over Long Lines (POLL) Act requires state governments to make sure that no voter has to wait in line for more than 30 minutes - and provide $500 million to make that a reality. No one should have to spend all day in line to cast their vote. With the Election Mail Act and POLL Act, I've now introduced seven bills in the 117th Congress to protect the sacred right to vote! Minority Entrepreneurship Grant Program Act Our Fighting Fifth small businesses are the backbone of our community, and everyone should have a fair shot at opening those businesses. Our HBCUs are already building our next generation of business leaders - and the federal government has to back up that work. I've introduced the Minority Entrepreneurship Grant Program Act to create a new grant program for HBCUs to support minority student entrepreneurs and business owners. PASSED Respect for Marriage Act We must make sure that any victim of human trafficking, or anyone who notices a potential victim, knows where to turn for help. I voted to pass the Human Trafficking Prevention Act of 2022 to post the contact information for the National Human Trafficking hotline in all federal buildings and in the restrooms of U.S. airplanes, trains and buses; as well as airports, train stations, and bus stations. Puerto Rico Status Act The people of Puerto Rico should have a choice and a chance to determine their own political future. I voted to bring that choice one step closer with the Puerto Rico Status Act, which would give Puerto Ricans autonomy to decide how they want to be part of the United States. Next up: the Senate needs to do the same. Police De-Escalation Training Act As many as half of all fatal police shootings involve people struggling with mental illness. Our friends, family, and neighbors experiencing mental health crises deserve law enforcement that is prepared to effectively and safely respond and protect them. I voted to pass the Law Enforcement De-Escalation Training Act to secure the money and training to make that happen. INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE Opposed the National Defense Authorization Act Earlier this month, I voted against this year's National Defense Authorization Act. As we continue to underinvest here at home, I believe that we must find better balance to keep Americans safe while investing in our future. I'm hopeful that the enactment of my Cost of War Act , which was included in the NDAA, will create the transparency we need to find that balance. I look forward to a future where our funding increases are for affordable housing, health care, paid leave, and child care. Congress in Your Community My team set up at the Forest Park library earlier this month to answer questions and start the casework process with constituents seeking help from federal you to everyone who joined us! ﻿Stay tuned for 2023 Congress in Your Community dates! Supporting our HBCUs: Celebration Bowl & UNCF Mayor's Masked Ball A mind is a terrible thing to waste and I had a fabulous time at two of my favorite events of the year. I started at the Celebration Bowl with Allstate, who presented $75,000 in scholarships to help build the next generation of HBCU made scholars. Later, I joined Mayor Andre Dickens for the UNCF Mayor's Masked Ball! This year's event raised a record-breaking $2.1 million for scholarship support. Team Nikema Helped Melissa and Piece of Cake from Atlanta Melissa is the co-founder of Piece of Cake bakery and since October of 2021 was attempting to receive her Employee Retention Tax Credit from the IRS. The bakery was unable to secure a response from the IRS about two outstanding payments. After expediting the request, the IRS sent the two last payments totaling $748,968. Melissa said: ""We are so thankful for Congresswoman Williams to expedite our Employee Retention Tax Credit. We've had a really hard year and we are beyond appreciative."" Rep.

If you miss the press release, don't despair, my gift to you this Christmas Sunday is to post it again HERE! It's well worth the read. True to my word, I voted against this colossal mess for many reasons. Here are a few of the more objectionable provisions in the bill: $45 billion to protect Ukraine's borders. $410 million to protect the borders of Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia and Oman. $0 to protect our own borders. $200 million to fund the Gender Equity Fund. $286 million to carry out programs under Title X, which funds Planned Parenthood. $535 million in payments to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. $1.4 billion in spending for membership in global multilateral organizations, including the United Nations. $575 million to fund reproductive health in areas where population growth threatens biodiversity and endangered species. $3 million to fund an American LGBTQ+ Museum in New York City. $3.6 million to build the Michelle Obama Trail in Georgia. $3 million to construct bee-friendly highways. Honestly, I can go on and on with many more outrageous examples but I think you get my point. I will simply end it here by restating what WASN'T funded: efforts to secure our southern border. It's true. In fact, the omnibus includes language that expressly prohibits any U.S. Customs and Border Patrol funds to be used to secure America's southern border. This last minute, lame duck legislation is a betrayal of American voters' wishes as expressed at the ballot box last month. Sadly 18 Republican Senators and Nine Republican Congressman voted with all but one democrat to crush our country. Words Matter: Why the Left Seeks to Change Policy with Language In the dystopian book ""1984"" by George Orwell, the authoritarian government in the story created its own language called ""Newspeak"" that was used to propagandize the people. Written as fiction, this fascist technique is and has been for decades, being used by the far left to pursue their immoral, unjust and bizarre policies. It also serves to demoralize people and confuse people about objective truths. The Left twists the English language in ways to convince people to embrace their patently unpopular and absurd positions. Let's look at the legal term, contained in the federal code, for people who come to our country illegally, or overstay their visas illegally. The law defines non-citizens as ""aliens."" 8 USC 1101(3) (""The term 'alien' means any person not a citizen or national of the United States""). For decades, the proper term widely used was ""illegal aliens."" At some point in the 1990's, the left, with their media lap dogs, decided the term did not portray their desire for open borders sympathetically. So, they started to call illegal aliens ""undocumented people"" or ""undocumented workers."" This misnomer was done to create the appearance that the only reason these people were illegal was that they were simply missing a piece of paper, some type of minor inconvenience. Like you not being able to find a receipt. But that was false then, and now. These illegals are not merely ""undocumented"" they are here in violation of our laws and they inflict economic losses, extreme cost on our law enforcement with higher crime and they burden our hospitals and schools and housing supply. They engage in sex trafficking, slavery and drug running. Illegal aliens brought enough fentanyl into our country in 2021 to kill over 100,000 of our young people. They take jobs and keep wages unduly low. They take apartments and cause rent prices to increase. In short, illegal aliens inflict a lot of damage to our country, but the Left is hoping if you call them ""undocumented"" they simply sound innocent and looking for a misplaced receipt. In the last two years, with a massive invasion underway of over five million illegal aliens, the media and the left now call illegal aliens ""migrants."" The term ""undocumented worker"" clearly was not sympathetic enough, so calling them ""migrants"" sounds like they are fleeing a war zone when, in fact, none are fleeing war zones. They are pouring into our country illegally to get welfare benefits, housing, health care and other benefits. Unfortunately, if you look at the newspapers and even some Republicans when they talk about the border, they are now using the term ""migrant."" If you use their definitions, you have already lost the argument. The correct term is ""illegal alien"" and we should all make sure to use the correct term. Always. There are similar propaganda phrases. Supporting the killing of innocent children in the womb is called ""pro-choice."" The choice, however, was made prior to pregnancy, that choice being to have unprotected sex. A baby is a human life, not a ""choice"" but the Left hopes to dehumanize the carnage that abortion inflicts. Cutting off the sexual organs of people is called by the Left ""gender affirmation surgeries,"" no longer a ""sex change."" You may be asking, why I am bringing this up now? Recently, Stanford University released a document trying to change the meaning of words to promote its immoral and illogical ideology to cover up its hatred for normalcy and biological reality. The project is titled ""The Elimination of Harmful Language Initiative."" George Orwell would be proud. The language they want us to use is to promote an anti-white, anti-male, anti-gender and anti-christian agenda. Of the many gems in its recently released manual to enshrine political correctness, a few stick out. The word ""American"" must be replaced by ""U.S. citizen,"" because they claim we would not want to be caught ""insinuating that the United States is the most important country in the Americas (which is actually made up of 42 countries)."" Right. To the Left, we are just one country, and not necessarily a very good country. Mexicans proudly refer to themselves as Mexicans. As they are entitled to do. We can and should call ourselves ""Americans"" and I urge all of you to do so wherever you go and whenever you can. Also, Stanford leftists now claim ""immigrant"" is even out, to be replaced by ""non-citizen"" or ""person who has immigrated."" A ""prostitute"" is now a ""person who engages in sex work."" An ""addicted"" person is now a ""devoted"" person. I kid you not. A ""devotee"" to drugs. Those suffering from alcoholism are ""devoted"" to alcohol. The left's disregard of the hundreds of thousands of people who die from drug overdoses thanks to the open southern border is reflected in this minimization of substance abuse. Saying ""ladies"" is no longer allowed. Or ""gentlemen."" Instead, they claim we should use the word ""people."" (Which may be offensive to the gay military guys who claim they are dogs but that's for them to figure out). Normal Americans will say, and continue to say ""ladies and gentlemen"" when greeting a crowd. The terms they want to ban are endless and nonsensical. Idioms used for centuries now bother them. For you grammarians out there, the language they propose is inelegant, cumbersome, awkward and stupid. Instead of saying ""chairman"" or ""chairwoman"" we are to say ""the head of this organization who may or may not identify as male or female who we are directing our attention to at this moment."" Let us all reject their abuse of our wonderful English language. Like most languages, our language is colorful, full of idioms and expressions and based on common human experiences. Nobody believes that when a realtor shows you the ""master bedroom"" they are promoting or referring to slavery. Nobody except the insane Left who know insist the master bedroom now be referred to as the ""primary bedroom."" It is easy to dismiss the Leftists and their propaganda as silly, uninformed and ridiculous. But based on the last 40 years of this continual assault on our language, culture and history, I can predict that classrooms, board rooms and government bureaucrats, along with their media collaborators, will be adopting this nonsense in their writings. The best way to stop that is to ridicule it, and continue to speak our language in the beautiful, precise and wonderful way it has evolved. Never use their ignorant terms. And the next time you hear the word ""migrant"" say it out loud: you mean illegal alien? Gosar's Efforts Leads to Passage of Water Bills Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed two Republican bills that I have worked tirelessly for several years to get enacted. S. 3308, the Colorado River Indian Tribes (CRIT) Water Resiliency Act and S. 4104, the Hualapai Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act both passed with resounding bi-partisan support. The CRIT Water Resiliency Act allows the Tribes to lease a part of its water allocation for use off the reservation to provide direct drought relief to surrounding Arizona communities while ensuring that no additional strain is placed on the already over-taxed Colorado River. The Hualapai Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act ratifies the Hualapai Tribe's Colorado River water settlement agreement, which will deliver approximately 4,000 acre-feet of water per year to the Tribe and serve the critical needs of the Tribal population, provide for economic opportunities, and provide long-term water resources for members of the Hualapai community. I was the sponsor of the Phase One Hualapai Settlement signed into law in December 2014. Completing Phase Two is extremely important to the Hualapai Tribe as well as numerous stakeholders and water users in Arizona. Both bills will finally give these Tribes control over their water and allow them to assist other communities in Arizona suffering from water supply challenges. Gosar Pushes National Park Service to Extend Public Comment Period for Lake Mead National Recreation Area A few weeks ago, in response to several requests for clarification from constituents, I wrote a letter to the National Park Service (NPS) asking for a 30-day extension for the public comment period regarding the new Sustainable Low Water Access Plan for Lake Mead National Recreation Area. I am pleased to report that the NPS has agreed to my request and is extending the public comment period through January 22, 2023. According to the NPS, the purpose of the Sustainable Low Water Access Plan is to develop a strategic direction for the future of motorized boat launching and related commercial services at five key access locations: Hemenway Harbor, Callville Bay Marina, Echo Bay, Temple Bar Marina, and South Cove. The Sustainable Low Water Access Plan/EA is critical to protect key resources, values, and visitor experiences and provide safe and responsible access to the lake. Previous planning did not anticipate the unprecedented rapid water level decline, and as such, a new plan is needed to continue providing safe and sustainable access to Lake Mead. Comments regarding the planning concepts should be made online here. New Report: Nancy Pelosi Responsible for Violence and Lack of Law Enforcement on January 6 The House minority released a report last week that came to devastating conclusions about the events leading up to and including January 6, 2021. As Speaker of the House, Pelosi was solely responsible for the security and safety of the facility, the members and staff. The Sergeant at Arms is supposed to protect the capitol and works with the Speaker to ensure law and order. It was suspected, and known by some that over two years ago, that Nancy Pelosi had more to do with the violence on January 6th than almost any other person. Law enforcement personnel had many meetings with her and her team and warned them well in advance that there would be some bad actors coming to disrupt President Trump's speech and peaceful rally. Instead of acting on this information, she intentionally ignored it. Some say she was hoping for violence to make President Trump look bad. Indeed, on January 6th itself, Pelosi was caught on film threatening to hit and attack President Trump. Thus, violence was to her a solution and a way to vent her anger at President Trump's successful term in office. Instead of warning members of Congress that members from Antifa, left-wing agitators and right-wing provocateurs were planning on attending to cause disruptions and violence, Pelosi did nothing. Not one call. Not one email. Not so much as a text to alert other members of Congress, thus putting all of them in jeopardy. Worse, she intentionally rejected the calls for additional law enforcement, including the National Guard. Further, Pelosi and the Sergeant at Arms plotted together to exclude any Republican from attending one of the security meetings. In this manner, they wanted to exploit the violence and use it against Republicans and endanger everyone's life. In addition, Pelosi failed to equip and train the Capitol Police adequately, leading to a poor security situation and lack of crowd control that day. In short, Pelosi intentionally denied security efforts, plotted in secret to harm President Trump, failed to train and equip law enforcement, and thus played a pivotal role in the violence that day. Had proper security steps been taken, there would have not been a riot or an incursion into the Capitol. In the next Congress, we will be investigating this to determine what sanctions should be imposed against Pelosi for her collusion, plotting and role in the violence that day. As well as her threats to physically harm President Trump. Topping it off was her conversations with General Milley and their joint plot for a military coup against President Trump. Our Republic cannot withstand fifth columns like Milley and Pelosi. They need to face a reconciliation and public airing over their misdeeds. It's Mail Time! I received a lot of mail last week on the omnibus spending package that was rushed through congress. Here is a small sample: Alana W. from Payson, AZ writes: Fight on Paul! Please let him know he is being encouraged for standing up for what is right and true! We value him greatly!! Dear Alana, thank you for your kind words. The fight continues! Herman Garcia shares his views: ﻿ Gosar - you are so ridiculous - you haven't voted for one single thing this administration has presented. Instead of making an attempt to work across the aisle - all you do is bitch and moan. When will you start to be a little more proactive. Take off your stupid maga hat and soak your head. Dear Herman, if this administration or the democrats in congress presented something I could support, I would vote in favor of it as I have a long record of introducing and co-sponsoring bi-partisan legislation. The two water bills I highlighted in this newsletter are some very recent examples, but there are countless other examples. Unfortunately, nearly all of the Biden administration's agenda is destroying America. Therefore, I cannot and will not support it. Mike K. had this to say: Hi Doctor, Just a note to let you know that we have no need to keep sending money to Ukraine. I'd like to put a moratorium on disbursement of the funds already in play, line item by line item, so that if it isn't actually ""spent"", the deal is off and we get the money back. Shut it down. Thank you for your support and service. Dear Mike, I have voted against every single bill to fund the war in Ukraine and I will not support any request that continues the needless death and destruction on both sides in this war. Our nation is under attack at the southern border, inflation is at an historic high and our country is buried in $31 trillion national debt. It is a huge error for Congress to have use this lame duck session to fast-track Biden's shameful request for pallets of taxpayer dollars to perpetuate a needless war. Rev. David S. from Clarkdale hates with the following: Congressman Gosar, I quote you from this most egregious newsletter an example of a white nationalist politician who voted for the ex-president's budget busting tax cut for the top 1% of America. ""We are broke, broken and over $31 trillion in debt and counting."" And you put us there! You Mr. Gosar need to look again at your approach to politics. You are a disgrace! Your disgusted constituent…for only a few more weeks. Dear Reverend, your hateful words portray a pattern of ungodly and disqualifying behavior. I pray this Christmas season that the love of Christ changes your heart. David D. from Lake Havasu City shares: Dear Congressman Gosar. You are right on every one of your points. The leadership in the house is corrupt, inept and acting against the good if the United States. Mitch is a disgrace. Keep up your good work. Make as much noise as you can. We are supporting you 100%. Dear David. Mitch McConnell's comments are delusional, America Last and treasonous. Ukraine is nowhere near the top concern in the United States. As long is Mitch is leader in the Senate, the Republicans will not be successful. Ken and Denise K. from Mohave Valley write: I commend you and your staff for recovering 2020 and 2021 tax refunds from the unresponsive IRS. Your staff bringing our situation to the IRS's top of mind definitely succeeded. We received the final refund yesterday. Thank you and Merry Christmas. Thanks Ken and Denise! We are happy to have been able to help. If anyone needs assistance with a federal agent, please send an email to my District Director, Penny Pew at @ and we will do our very best to help.

Awesome picture, Paul! Thanks for sharing and thanks for your service. Now, who is next!? Do you have photography skills?

120," District Update December 28, 2022 Open in browser window About Contact Issues Services Dear    , I hope you and your family have enjoyed the holiday season. We are just days away from a new year, so I wanted to provide you with a breakdown of some of my work this past year while representing you in Congress and back home in Arizona's sixth district. January At the start of this year, I got right to work with holding our federal agencies accountable. When the Treasury Department publicly stated that Americans should expect delays in receiving their tax returns, my colleagues and I sent a bipartisan letter to Secretary Yellen urging her to take actionable steps to fix the backlog issues and get the IRS moving efficiently. Click the image above to read the full letter. February In February, I had the immense pleasure of participating in a roundtable with some of the hardworking small business owners in our district. It was a productive conversation on how small businesses help lift our local economy, and how we as members of the community can best support them. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and as a member of Congress, I will continue to fight for policies that unwind bureaucratic red tape imposed on them and lower their tax burden. March In March, I had the opportunity to meet with Scottsdale Police Chief Jeff Walther, who was named Arizona's Police Chief of the Year. I was honored to recognize him for his outstanding efforts to keep our community safe and hear about his leadership throughout his time in service. I am grateful for all of the men and women in our district who bravely serve us each day and I look forward to continuing to find ways to support them in Congress. April In April, I hosted a roundtable discussion on the fentanyl epidemic. I heard from local, state, and federal officials on the struggle to contain this crisis, and I listened as parents, doctors, and members of the community told me about the tragic stories that have devastated families in our district. As a border state, Arizona is a gateway to the rest of the country for this deadly narcotic. We must do everything we can to stop the flow of fentanyl, and that starts by securing our Southern border. As we move into a new year and new Congress, I will continue to shed light on this issue and do everything in my power to end this crisis. May In May, I was honored to receive an award alongside Leader Kevin McCarthy for our efforts in bringing awareness to Valley Fever. This fungal disease, more formally known as coccidioidomycosis, is becoming more prevalent across the Southwest and many constituents of the sixth district have a personal experience with it. As co-chair of the Congressional Valley Fever Task, I am advocating for better detection and treatment options for those affected by this terrible disease. This year brought many developments in drug and vaccine developments, which I was pleased to see, but we still have a lot of work to do. I remain committed to expanding awareness around this public health problem so that we may increase research initiatives and beat Valley Fever once and for all. June In June, Joyce, Olivia, and I welcomed our son Matthew to the world! We were so pleased to adopt another child into the Schweikert family and are incredibly grateful for all the well wishes and congratulations we received from the community. July In July, I was proud to introduce H.R. 8579, the Retirement Protection Act. This piece of legislation is designed to play a critical role in fighting inflation while helping Americans protect their savings. Specifically, this bill would raise the yearly contribution limit for Roth and Traditional IRAs to $10,000 and raise the workplace retirement yearly contribution limit to $24,500. Click the image above for more information on this legislation. August In August, I was happy to meet with Judy Wilson and Dominic Braham of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society to discuss the issues that individuals with MS face and what Congress can do to help those who suffer from this challenging diagnosis. As co-chair of the Telehealth caucus, I will continue to be a strong advocate for access to and quality of healthcare, in our country. That starts with implementing competition to lower costs in all aspects of healthcare - including critical treatments and resources for those facing difficulties with MS. September In September, I was proud to have been once again named a Legislative Leader by the Humane Society . Throughout my time in Congress, I'm proud to have supported and introduced legislation that protects both wild and domestic animals. This Congress, I introduced the Paws Off Act , legislation that would promote safe labeling requirements for pet safety, and the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Protection Act of 2022 which aims to make humane reforms to the federal government's management of wild horses and burros. I look forward to reintroducing these bills next Congress and finding even more ways to protect animals from all walks of life! October In October, I attended the Gold Star Family Memorial dedication ceremony at the Wesley Bolin Plaza at the Arizona State Capitol. This event formally dedicated a new memorial to the families of service members who have given the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. Families honored their deceased loved ones by placing Gold Stars next to their names. We will never forget the brave men and women who served and sacrificed for our country. November In Mid-November, I had the privilege of joining the Rare Access Action Project's 3rd annual meeting on health policy. We discussed how we can improve rare disease patients' access to services, therapies, and care. The research being done to provide our brothers and sisters with access to innovative therapies is vital to our future. We desperately need this important research to continue to improve the quality of life and lives for patients and their loved ones. Already, there are autonomous health clinics right here in Arizona, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has dozens of personalized gene therapies in the developmental pipeline, and developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have made diagnosing health more accurate than ever before. I will continue to work to advance these revolutionary technologies that will provide better care, at a fraction of the cost. December Dr. C.T. Wright is remembered as a mentor and true leader throughout the education, criminal justice, and faith communities in Arizona. As a devoted public servant and valued neighbor, C.T.

121," Wrapping up the 117th Congress! Updates from Congressman Vargas Dear Friend, It is my honor to represent you in Washington. In the 117 th Congress, I was proud to work alongside my Congressional colleagues to deliver important and historic legislative wins for our community. As we continued to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, I voted to pass the American Rescue Plan, which helped the hardest-hit communities recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. And Congressional Democrats successfully passed a once-in-a-century investment to rebuild our nation's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, transit, and clean drinking water and wastewater systems through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In August, I was proud to pass the Inflation Reduction Act to help lower prescription drug prices, create good-paying jobs, and make historic investments to combat climate change. I'm committed to fighting for you and our community in Congress My colleagues and I delivered on President Biden's promise to strengthen domestic manufacturing when we passed the CHIPS and Science Act. The CHIPS and Science Act has made historic investments that will create good-paying-jobs, strengthen American manufacturing, our supply chains, and national security. And we followed through on President Biden's promise to strengthen health care and benefits for our country's veterans by signing the bipartisan PACT Act into law, ensuring our veterans receive the health care benefits they deserve after bravely serving our nation. Following the deadly mass shootings in Buffalo, NY, and Uvalde, TX, I voted passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a landmark piece of legislation that will protect Americans from further senseless tragedies. I'm proud to have accomplished so much for our district this year, and I look forward to working with my bipartisan colleagues to continue delivering for you and our community. Sincerely, JUAN VARGAS Member of Congress Combating Cross-Border Pollution in the Tijuana River Valley Last week, I was proud to secure the transfer of $300 million from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) to begin addressing harmful pollution in the Tijuana River Valley. My San Diego Delegation colleagues and I have been working to get this transfer across the finish line for three years, and I'm extremely pleased that our provision was included in the Fiscal Year 2023 government funding package and signed into law by President Biden. $35 Million is Headed to Our District Last week, I voted to secure nearly $35 million in Community Project Funding in the 2023 Fiscal Year government funding legislation. Our community will benefit from long overdue updates to our transportation systems, academic support for DREAMers, better access to healthcare and family services, and more parks and green spaces for underserved communities. I'm proud to have championed funding for 15 community projects, and will continue fighting to ensure our community receives the investments it needs to thrive. To learn more about these projects, click here . Resources for COVID-19 COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are readily available in our district: San Diego County Vaccine Locations Imperial County Vaccine Locations COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are always free, and you won't be asked about your immigration status. The federal government has been working hard to deliver COVID-19 resources to reduce the spread of the virus. Families can order up to four free at-home COVID-19 tests at , or call 1-800-232-0233 if you are unable to access the website. Passing the Respect for Marriage Act Earlier this month, House Democrats demonstrated their commitment to fight for equality for every American in passing the Respect for Marriage Act. This legislation enshrines marriage equality for same sex and interracial couples into federal law. It was an honor to vote for this landmark legislation, and to watch President Biden sign it into law. Love is love! Veterans Service Recognition Act As an original cosponsor of the Veteran Service Recognition Act, I am proud to have voted for and worked alongside my Democratic colleagues to pass this landmark piece of legislation in the House. Immigrant veterans risked their lives to keep our nation safe, and they deserve a pathway to citizenship. We should not turn our backs on those who put their lives on the line to secure and defend our country. People who served our country deserve to stay in our country. Immigrant Military Member Resources The Department of Homeland Security has created an online resource hub for non-citizen servicemembers to find information on applying for U.S. citizenship.

122," Message from Rep. Tracey Mann. Having Trouble Viewing? Click Here. Fellow Kansan, Thank you for subscribing to my newsletter! I'm excited to update you on my work in Washington, D.C. and the First District of Kansas. Please feel free to share this email with family and friends who may be interested. As always, if you have any comments, questions, or concerns, please contact my office - my staff and I are here and ready to assist you. Yours in service, In the Office Rep. Mann's bill renaming Russell Post Office after Sen. Bob Dole becomes law I am pleased that my bill renaming the Russell, Kansas post office after Senator Bob Dole passed in Congress last week and has been signed into law. I spent some time with Senator Dole just a few weeks before he passed away. During our time together we discussed what he called ""The Kansas Approach,"" the markers of which he identified as honesty, hard work, respect for your roots, common sense, service, simplicity, and genuine, thoughtful care for people. These are the Kansas conservative values that motivate me every day. Senator Dole made it clear during his life that we must never forget where we come from. He knew that the heartbeat of our nation lies in places like his hometown of Russell. Naming a post office after one of Kansas' favorite sons in the town where he grew up is a small but meaningful way to pay tribute to this Kansas giant and American hero. Read the full text of the legislation here. Watch my remarks on the House Floor honoring Senator Dole's life. Tracking My Time in Congress Whether it's voting on the House Floor, assisting with casework, introducing legislation, or keeping you up to date with my current work in Congress - my number one priority is serving Kansans. Over the past two years, my staff and I have corresponded with and assisted thousands of Kansans, and we will continue to serve you in the 118 th Congress.

This was the first time in modern American history that one party has jammed an omnibus bill through Congress during the lame-duck session after losing control of the House. It's plain and simple - this bad legislation passed in a dishonest, untimely way. House Republicans are prepared to pass pro-economic growth policies, curb out-of-control government spending, and fight against regulations that hamstring American businesses from flourishing. Watch my Mann Minute about voting against the Lame-Duck Spending Bill. ICYMI: Mann Minute on my Resolution Nullifying Lesser Prairie-Chicken Listing Last week, I introduced a resolution that calls for a congressional review of the Biden Administration's rule designating the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened species in places like Kansas. The legislation states that the rule should have no force or effect unless Congress is consulted. I will continue to fight against this proxy war on American energy producers and agriculturists and will reintroduce the same legislation in the 118 th Congress. Watch my Mann Minute below: In the District World's Largest Belt Buckle Unveiled in Abilene Congratulations to Abilene on the unveiling of the world's largest belt buckle! The giant buckle stands at 19 feet 10 ½ inches wide and 13 feet 11 ¼ inches tall - not including the frame. Kansas has been the first frontier for cowboys since the 1860s when cattle were driven from Texas to towns like Abilene and Dodge City to be sold near the closest railroads. Today, the Big First District is home to more than 4.4 million cattle on ranches and feed yards, and to the hardworking producers who care for them. I can't think of a better place to pay tribute to the American cowboy than in a true cowboy town like Abilene. Read more about the World's Largest Belt Buckle here. Happening Across the Country U.S. Supreme Court Rules to Keep Title 42 in Place for the Near Future Yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that Title 42 will remain in effect while it undergoes baseless claims in the courtroom. ﻿ Every nation has the right to secure its borders and control its entry process. The Biden Administration, however, has instituted open-door policies that led to a record 2.76 million illegal border crossings in fiscal year 2022 alone. I've been to the southern border and witnessed the humanitarian crisis that these policies have caused. This chaos is unacceptable and avoidable. We have an immigration process for a reason - to ensure the orderly admission of individuals into the United States after they have been vetted. In light of the situation at our southern border, keeping Title 42 in place makes perfect sense, which is why the highest court in the land has upheld it. I hope that this week's decision will further cement that maintaining Title 42 during a crisis like this one is logical and necessary . Click here to read more. In just a few days, we will ring in 2023 with anticipation and hope for change. The New Year gives us an opportunity to examine ourselves, and reassess our goals and ambitions. Most of all, the New Year reminds us of the greatest privilege we have living in a free nation where we have the right to life, and liberty, and where we can pursue happiness as we see fit. We have a lot of work to do to get America back on track. Next week, the 118th Congress begins, and I am looking forward to sharing my Commitment to the Big First.

In this last e-newsletter to you of the 117th Congress, I want to report back on a very successful appropriations (federal funding) year for Hawai'i, as well as the results and lessons of my last Constituent Survey.

This measure included many of my initiatives with billions more of assistance for Hawai'i, such as another $1 billion for Red Hill (over and above the $1.1 billion we secured for Fiscal Year 2022), and over $94 million for fourteen very worthy and needed community projects. Here is much more on what I worked to include in this year's appropriations 2022 Constituent Survey Results I deeply appreciate all of the responses to my final constituent survey of the 117th Congress, not only the answers to each question but the individual comments, all of which I read personally.

124," Sen. Rick Scott is Fighting to Hold Social Media Execs Accountable for Censoring Free Speech ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ NEWS ALERT! Sen. Rick Scott is Fighting to Hold Social Media Execs Accountable for Censoring Free Speech Sen. Rick Scott to Social Media Execs: Congress Will Hold You Accountable for Censoring Speech & Lying Under Oath Senator Rick Scott sent letters to leaders of social media companies Meta, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube demanding answers regarding the extent of their knowledge of the platforms' censorship. Earlier this year in a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee hearing, the executives testified under oath their respective companies were not shadow banning or manipulating news feeds to censor speech. Recent reports, such as Twitter Files, have shown this testimony to be at a minimum misleading, and potentially false. In his letter, Senator Scott makes clear that if social media executives lied under oath, they must be held accountable. Read the full letters HERE or below. December 14, 2022 The disturbing evidence of Big Tech's meddling and censorship highlighted in recent ""Twitter Files"" releases have demanded the attention of the Congress and the American people. These disclosures, allowed at the direction of Elon Musk, confirm that the federal government and Big Tech have been working in concert to both suppress conservative speech limit the free flow of information to American users, regardless of the factual nature of such material. This unprecedented coordination between the federal government and private social media corporations to remove user content or actively block the spread of news prior to a presidential election, such the New York Post's reporting on the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop, raise serious legal and constitutional questions that must be immediately answered. On September 14, 2022, you testified before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on ""Social Media's Impact on Homeland Security"" stating that the federal government did not direct you or your company to suppress speech on your platform. This testimony was grossly misleading, and I believe you knowingly lied to the Committee and the American people while under oath about the extent of your interactions and coordination with the federal government for content moderation and the suppression of content on your platform. It was revealed in October, through court documents and reporting by the Intercept, that Facebook and other social media platforms created a censorship portal for the federal government, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and even White House officials, to request account ""takedowns"" and infringe on Americans' speech they did not agree with. [1] Topics censored included, ""the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, racial justice, U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the nature of U.S. support to Ukraine."" Americans have a right to political speech, which is protected by the First Amendment regardless of whether such speech is critical of government policy. This sacred right, afforded to all American citizens, relies on the free exercise of speech without fear of government interference or intimidation. That is certainly why court documents concluded that, ""This case involves a massive, sprawling federal 'Censorship Enterprise,' which includes dozens of federal officials across at least eleven federal agencies and components, who communicate with social-media platforms about misinformation, disinformation, and the suppression of private speech on social media-all with the intent and effect of pressuring social-media platforms to censor and suppress private speech that federal officials disfavor."" [2] These disturbing revelations must be immediately answered for. According to the evidence I have cited here, Big Tech has engaged in a conspiracy, with the full support of the Executive Branch of the United States Government, to limit the free speech of American citizens and deny the exercise of one of the most fundamental rights afforded to us in the Constitution. These attacks on speech will not be forgotten or ignored and I demand that you address these issues, at the earliest possible date, and comprehensively revisit your previous testimony, which has now been proven false. The American people deserve nothing less than full accountability and transparency from you and your company. I appreciate your attention to this serious matter. Sincerely, [1] [2] Read more HERE . Sen. Rick Scott and Colleagues Win Big: Bill to Ban TikTok on Government Devices Becomes Law Senator Scott and colleagues celebrated the passing of their bill to ban TikTok on government devices. This bill follows up on steps already taken by the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security , the Department of Defense , and TSA to ban the app on federal government devices due to security concerns. Senator Hawley originally introduced the legislation last Congress and it unanimously passed the Senate in August 2020.

Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and all its impacts, the 117th Session has made historic advances on several fronts. This progress began nearly two years ago, when we passed the American Rescue Plan - which got vaccine shots in arms, helped shore up small businesses, and gave our economy the boost it needed to prevent long-term damage. We followed that key measure with another piece of ground-breaking legislation: the infrastructure modernization law - the single largest investment in our nation's transportation networks, ports, communications, and water systems in decades. Through this law, we're delivering over $7 billion to Maryland over the next five years for roads, bridges, broadband, transit, water systems, and more - to fix the aging infrastructure of the past and build the physical backbone of the 21st century. And, in addition to those guaranteed funds coming to our state, this initiative also includes nearly $150 billion in competitive national grant funding - and Maryland counties and cities have already begun to compete successfully for those funds. This year, Congress kicked our efforts into even higher gear with a series of major legislative achievements - from the PACT Act to provide better health care for our veterans, to the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to take a meaningful step forward on gun safety, to the CHIPS and Science Act to sharpen America's competitive edge and bring manufacturing jobs back home. Finally, in the culmination of many of our efforts, we succeeded in passing the Inflation Reduction Act , which will help us lower the price of Medicare prescription drugs, confront the climate crisis, and ensure that wealthy corporations pay more of their fair share. This transformative measure will help build a better future for our nation and our world. We've gotten a lot done this Congress - but our work is far from over. Going forward, we need to make sure all of the federal resources we signed into law get out the door and into our communities. Now is our chance to implement the legislative victories we've secured in a targeted and equitable way - so we can strengthen Maryland's infrastructure, ensure true public safety, lower the cost of everyday items, fight the climate crisis, ensure greater access to affordable health care, open the doors to opportunity even wider for our children and Maryland families, and grow more shared prosperity for all. I know we'll meet those challenges head-on by working together. Keeping Maryland Strong As we've worked to achieve our year-end priorities, I've partnered with colleagues from both parties to pass legislation that will directly benefit Marylanders everywhere. This month, Congress passed a major bill to fund the government through next fall, preventing a shameful shutdown and investing in the priorities of our nation over the next year. I fought for key provisions in that bill to improve Americans' access to child care, expand educational and workforce training opportunities, provide quality and affordable health care, conserve our environment and the Chesapeake Bay, and build more shared prosperity. I also worked to include major wins for our state - from historic resources for Bay clean-up efforts to a fairer process for moving forward to select the site for a new FBI headquarters in our region. The bill also bolsters the work of Marylanders at the heart of our federal workforce - backing our civilian employees, advancing ground-breaking work at our research agencies and medical institutions like NIH, and helping provide services to our constituents. These highlights are in addition to the more than $215 million in direct federal investments that I helped secure alongside Senator Cardin for local projects in communities across Maryland - to boost economic opportunity, enhance public safety, and expand access to health care and many other important services. While I was deeply disappointed that Republicans refused to support a number of key priorities, it was vital that we pass a new government funding bill instead of kicking the can down the road. On balance, this package will meaningfully invest in the critical priorities of our state and nation. On top of that, I fought successfully to secure provisions from my HBCU RISE Act to spur more advanced research investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions - including Morgan State University and UMES here in Maryland - through the annual defense bill passed by Congress. I also worked to include provisions in that legislation from my Service to the Fleet Act to authorize $636 million for a major infrastructure overhaul of the Curtis Bay Coast Guard Yard in Maryland that will go toward upgrading the WWII-era facilities there. The Yard is the Coast Guard's sole shipbuilding and major repair facility as well as a critical economic driver for Maryland, directly and indirectly creating thousands of good-paying skilled union jobs. We know the Yard and the hard-working men and women who keep it running need the proper infrastructure and equipment to continue to provide top-notch support for our nation's homeland defense, which is why our push to deliver these essential funds is so important. Lastly, this bill includes language I authored to address a concern I've heard about directly from constituents regarding the loss of their documents when applying for passports . My new provision will ensure that passports and the documents that accompany them can be sent back to applicants by tracked mail so folks don't encounter these problems. Taken together, these provisions will improve the lives of everyday Marylanders and help our nation thrive for years to come. Fighting for Justice, Equality, and Love No American should face discrimination - no matter whom they love or where they live. But in the wake of the Supreme Court's polarizing actions over the past few years and efforts by Republican-controlled state legislatures to strip away rights that Americans hold dear, it's clear that basic constitutional protections are under assault. That includes protections for interracial couples and same-sex couples everywhere. We knew Congress needed to act - and that's what we did. The Respect for Marriage Act promises married couples that their union will be given equal recognition and protection across the United States, providing the peace of mind that no court, state legislature, or local government can interfere with their marriage. I was proud to cast my vote in favor of this bill , and I joined President Biden at the White House as his signature affirmed what we already know to be true: love wins! This is an important step forward, but we have so much farther to go in ensuring that all of our communities are afforded equal rights and equal protection under the law - and I'll keep fighting to ensure equal and just treatment for every American. Ringing in the New Year The New Year marks a season of optimism, as we look ahead toward brighter days. We've accomplished so much already, but I know we can do even more in the weeks, months, and years to come. And we're entering 2023 with a group of public servants from all across our state who are determined to tackle the challenges we face. From my colleagues in the Maryland congressional delegation, to new leadership in Annapolis, to strong local leaders and dedicated community partners, Team Maryland is poised to accomplish many good things. I look forward to working with our new Governor-Elect Wes Moore, Lieutenant Governor-Elect Aruna Miller, and all Marylanders to move our state and our country forward. It's in that spirit that I want to wish everyone a season of love, light, and hope as we ring in the New Year, and I look forward to hearing from you soon - so we can hit the ground running in 2023!

129," News from Representative Johnson December 28, 2022 Dear  , What to Expect While many are planning their new year's resolutions, getting ready to go back to school, and soaking up the last days of the holidays, Congress is gearing up for a shift in majority. The top of many minds and news stories is the race for House Speaker. While there has been some uncertainty of a Speaker Kevin McCarthy (CA), I believe he will prevail. We have much more important things to focus on-like the border, inflation, China, and crime-so I am hopeful the Speaker vote will move quickly. Here's a few things to expect from a Republican-led House of Representatives: Fiscal Responsibility - America is more than $32 trillion in debt. This is not a problem to be ignored and left to our children to solve. A Republican-led House will be able to block any additional reckless spending by the Biden Administration and Congressional Democrats. Doing so will help slow inflation. Over the past two years, I have opposed more than $13 trillion in Democrat spending packages and will continue to do the same. China - China is not our friend. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) continues to expand its authoritarian regime in multiple spheres of our lives. Their negative influence of TikTok content for American youth and increased purchases American farmland and ag businesses poses a geopolitical threat to our national security. Next Congress, Republicans will establish a Select Committee on China to investigate the CCP's actions and propose policies to ensure America is prepared to tackle this security threat. Border Security - The situation at the southern border is a crisis-a humanitarian crisis, national security crisis, and public safety crisis. I'm grateful the end of Title 42 was delayed last week, preventing a greater influx of migrants at our border that is already under stress. I'm hopeful for bipartisan support in this area to secure our border and increase public safety. Farm Bill - Every five years, the Farm Bill gets reauthorized. The last Farm Bill was authorized in 2018, which means it needs adjusted and passed again in 2023. Some titles that are included are conservation, crop insurance, and nutrition programs. I'm hopeful to be a chairman of a subcommittee within the House Agriculture Committee, giving me a lead role in drafting parts of this bill. The next Congress will be pretty busy, and I am looking forward to bringing home more wins for South Dakota.

130," December 28, 2022 Dear friend, During the 117th Congress, I worked with my colleagues on several bipartisan efforts to counter antisemitism. I also strongly support our close democratic ally, Israel, and believe that assistance for Israel is more critical now than ever. The U.S. Congress must continue to ensure that Israel has the tools that it needs to defend itself. Interparliamentary Taskforce on Online Antisemitism As co-chair of the Interparliamentary Taskforce on Online Antisemitism , I participated in several events during the September summit in Washington, D.C. On the first day, my colleagues and I joined a lunch with several conferences of presidents of major American Jewish organizations. On the second day of the summit, the Interparliamentary Task Force to Combat Online Antisemitism held a hearing with top social media officials. To watch the hearing, please click here . Letters I joined my colleagues in a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken regarding the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) Commission of Inquiry (COI) on Israel. As members of the Latino Jewish Caucus, my colleagues and I sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressing concern regarding Chilean President Gabriel Boric's refusal to accept the credentials of the Israeli ambassador to Chile, Gil Artzyeli. Moreover, I joined my colleagues in a bipartisan, bicameral letter urging President Biden to develop a strategy to counter antisemitism and strengthen interagency coordination. Legislation In May, I cosponsored Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz's resolution . 1125 condemning rising antisemitism that calls on elected officials, faith, and civil society leaders to condemn antisemitism in all forms. Furthermore, the resolution calls for renewed efforts to combat antisemitism domestically, globally, and online. This resolution passed the House. In July, I cosponsored Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz's resolution . 1231 condemning the attack on the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in July 1994, demanding accountability and expressing the concern for the 28-year-long delay in the resolution of this case. Thank You Hurricane Ian left behind catastrophic damage in the state of Florida. After the storm, Consul General Maor Elbaz-Starinsky and his team delivered supplies to different areas of the state. I am grateful for his country's compassion and support in the aftermath of this disaster throughout multiple areas of my district, such as Everglades City. Supporting the Iranian People Iran continues to be one of the most dangerous regimes in the world. The murderous mullahs in Iran are killing protesters to silence dissent and maintain their illegitimate grip on power. These thugs must be held accountable for their crimes. In July, I was sanctioned by the Iranian regime for my work in supporting Israel, opposing the terrorist state of Iran, and expressing support for the Iranian people in their democratic aspirations. The Iranian people will be free, and they will remember those who stood with them.

And it has also been one of Congress's most productive times in modern history. Since I last wrote to you over the summer, we've continued to be laser-focused on attacking inflation and lowering costs for working families. That work reached new success in August when we passed the* historic Inflation Reduction Act *- which slashed costs for health care and energy by making the biggest corporations pay their fair share. Starting in the new year,* tens of thousands of seniors in our district will save significantly on lifesaving medications* thanks to the bill's new $2,000 annual cap on prescription drug costs, and $35 monthly cap on insulin. [image: Image] The *Inflation Reduction Act *also represents* the single-biggest investment in fighting the climate crisis *in American history. It will put us on track to stop the worst effects of climate change, while creating thousands of new jobs in the growing green economy.* And yet, still more work needs to be done to protect our planet. * Congress has also been working to safeguard the rights and freedoms that are under threat from hyperpartisan Supreme Court decisions. To my great disappointment, *the House-passed legislation to codify Roe v. Wade* did not make it through the Senate during this legislative session. But we will continue to fight to protect abortion access with the same determination in the new year. In the meantime, both chambers were able to come together to pass the* Respect for Marriage Act,* which made *marriage equality for same-sex and interracial couples the law of the land. *That we had to take such steps to protect this basic right in 2022 is tragic. But rest assured, I will continue to be on the frontline of fights to defend fundamental freedoms for all of my constituents. [image: Image] Throughout the fall and winter, my colleagues and I on the *January 6 Committee *continued to interview scores of witnesses and gather evidence about the events that led to that dark day. We recently released our final report which makes* criminal referrals to the Justice Department -* including several for Donald Trump. So as 2022 comes to a close, I want to tell you again how honored I am to be your voice in Congress. Wishing you and your family a happy, healthy 2023, and Happy Holidays! [image: Image] Member of Congress [image: Image] [image: Image] *[image: Image]* *Funding Community Projects* This year, Congressman Schiff secured $7.7 million in federal funds to support ten local health, housing, education, and cultural programs across California's 28th District - from a new small business incubator in the Thai Town Marketplace , to new beds at an emergency shelter for youth experiencing homelessness , to critical funding for the new Armenian American Museum. *Fighting Homelessness* For the latest round of community projects, Congressman Schiff requested nearly $15.4 million in federal funds - including more than $10 million for local homeless services projects that improve access to health care, mental health and substance abuse support, and job and housing resources. *Improving Our Education System* Congressman Schiff introduced two pieces of legislation this year to support students and educators: The *RAISE Act* to boost teacher compensation, and the *Food for Thought Act* to create free meal programs on community college and minority-serving institution campuses. *Preventing the Spread of Mpox* As mpox began to spread across Los Angeles, Congressman Schiff led the charge to stop the virus in its tracks - successfully urging the Biden administration to ramp up vaccine manufacturing, distribution, and community outreach. *Ending Animal Cruelty in Marine Settings* California is home to many aquatic parks that keep highly intelligent marine mammals - like orcas, beluga whales, pilot whales, and false killer whales - in captivity, despite the adverse impact on their wellbeing. Congressman Schiff introduced a bill to end the future capture and breeding of whales for public display. *Supporting the Armenian Diaspora* Congressman Schiff continued to fight for the Armenian community's priorities at home and abroad - from leading the charge to cease American assistance to Azerbaijan in the wake of its horrific attacks on Armenia and Artsakh , to securing nearly $1 million for the Armenian American Museum in downtown Glendale. [image: Image] *Delivering Relief at the Gas Pump* Congressman Schiff led the fight to take on oil companies' shameless price-gouging and save Californians' hard-earned money at the pump, by introducing legislation to suspend the federal gas tax and pay for it with a new tax on Big Oil's excess profits. *Slashing Prescription Drug and Energy Prices* In August, Congressman Schiff proudly voted 'yes' on the *Inflation Reduction Act,* historic legislation that caps the cost of insulin, allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices, and slashes energy costs by making the largest-ever investment in clean energy and fighting climate change. *Fixing Our Broken Supply Chains* Over the summer, Congressman Schiff supported the *CHIPS & Science Act* *,* which will save families money by investing in American research and manufacturing to ensure essential goods are made at home. [image: Image] *Fighting to Restore the Right to Choose* After the Supreme Court made its dangerous decision to take away reproductive rights, Congressman Schiff urged Congress to act, and voted 'yes' to codify *Roe v. Wade* . The Senate has failed to get this legislation across the finish line - which is yet another reason why Congressman Schiff continues to call for an end to the filibuster. *Enshrining Marriage Equality* The Supreme Court has shown its willingness to strip away the fundamental freedoms of millions - so Congressman Schiff took action to ensure that LGBTQ+ couples and interracial couples don't need to live in fear of their reactionary rulings. The *Respect for Marriage Act* enshrines marriage equality as the law of the land. *Standing Up for Reproductive Freedom* With* Roe v. Wade*'s demise, Congressman Schiff has supported and led on efforts to protect other key components of reproductive freedom, such as the right to contraceptives and the right for LGBTQ+ couples to start families of their own . *Standing Up for Your Safety* Congressman Schiff supported historic, bipartisan gun safety legislation that will enact meaningful, commonsense reforms to keep people safe from horrific gun violence. And his legislation to allow gun violence victims and their families to sue negligent firearm dealers and manufacturers made critical progress. [image: Image] *Investigating the January 6 Insurrection* As a member of the January 6 Committee , Congressman Schiff has been dedicated to investigating the multiple lines of effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The committee's final report includes all of the evidence, as well as remedies designed to prevent another insurrection in the future. *Rooting Out Corruption* In 2022, Congressman Schiff re-introduced his constitutional amendment to overturn the *Citizens United* decision , which allowed wealthy donors and special interest groups to pour billions of dollars into our elections and has eroded public trust in government. *Standing with Ukraine* When Vladimir Putin launched his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the United States and its allies launched into action to hold Putin accountable for his war of aggression. In May, Congressman Schiff traveled to Kyiv to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and discuss ways Congress can continue to aid the Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom. *Ending Iran's Mistreatment of Political Prisoners* In response to the historic protests across Iran, Congressman Schiff introduced the *Support for Iranian Political Prisoners Act* , legislation demanding Iran end its human rights violations and immediately release all arbitrarily detained individuals - including peaceful protestors, political prisoners, and prisoners of conscience. Congressman Schiff's bill was included in this year's national defense legislation. [image: Image] [image: Image] [image: Image] [image: Image] *BURBANK* 245 E.

I am grateful for all that Tery, along with Steven Angotti, Tania Fernandez, Damaris Gonzalez and Sean Saintil - as well as the help of the entire Castor Team - did this year and will continue to do in 2023. Their expertise and compassion have been critical to ensuring that veterans receive the benefits they have earned and to guarantee that survival stimulus payments, Social Security, Medicare are delivered on time. Amazingly, 812 federal grants bolstered neighborhoods from North Tampa to USF to West Tampa and more - for a total of $2,312,900,550 including important investments in housing, Tampa's Riverwalk, safer streets, and medical research. I love my hometown and am committed to lifting every neighbor through growing public transit system, Feeding Tampa Bay is expanding local food assistance, local organizations are investing in skilled trades training to expand good-paying jobs and apprenticeships and so much more. Our health heroes - present and future - received a major boost with a $1 million grant from the Department of Health and Human Services to USF that is aimed at recruiting and training nursing students and current registered nurses to increase access to care, with an emphasis on chronic disease prevention and control, including mental health and substance use conditions. HART also received a $300,000 grant through American Rescue Plan funds that helped them restore service and keep essential services moving after the pandemic. Bay Area Legal Services is always there for our neighbors, and an $800,000 grant has helped struggling individuals and families with free and low-cost legal services to recover from natural disasters. The Tampa community is blessed with volunteers and organizations who are working to creatively and compassionately solve problems, and I was proud to partner with them to get these initiatives over the finish line. Not included in that amount are the 16 federal grants - totaling $132,304, 671 - that our district has secured from the Infrastructure Investment and Job Act. From funds to fix our roads and expand safe pathways for pedestrians and cyclists, we are building back better and more resiliently, and creating jobs along the way, and we'll all benefit from these funds. The Port of Tampa Bay also received a critical $12.6M grant that will create good-paying jobs and build a new dock so that larger cargo ships can utilize the Port. We'll see lower costs through this construction and cement Port Tampa Bay's place as a thoroughfare that's critical to our state and nation's economy. 2023 IS LOOKING BRIGHT Looking ahead, we have already received good news that $28 million in localized grants critical to our economy and our neighbors' well-being will be headed to the Tampa Bay area in the new year. Working together, we will ensure that every Tampa Bay neighbor has the opportunity to grow and thrive across our community. I am proud that these community projects will help tackle the rising cost of living, educate the next generation, and create good-paying jobs organizations lift our community. I am grateful for the work of my team and the partnership of local leaders, businesses and nonprofits that allows our community to secure grants that will keep Tampa Bay a great place to live and work. I look forward to connecting in the new year and continuing to provide updates on how I am working for you in Washington and Tampa Bay.

Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. Wishing Kansans a Merry Christmas Robba and I wish you and your loved ones a Merry Christmas and very happy holiday season. May this be a time filled with special moments and creating memories that will last for years to come. This holiday season, let each of us also remember our military men and women, first responders and law enforcement officers who are away from their families over Christmas. I am grateful to each of them for their selfless dedication and service, and I wish them a very Merry Christmas. Thanking Our Troops Robba and I are also thinking of our troops who are deployed overseas this holiday season. Spending Christmas far from loved ones is never easy, and it is a sacrifice so many of our troops and military families make to keep our nation safe. I am praying for their safe return and many future holidays surrounded by family and loved ones. You can watch my full Christmas message to our troops here . FY2023 Appropriations Package, Fulfilling Our Promise to Fully Fund Our Troops Many Kansans have expressed concerns regarding the FY2023 Appropriations Package passed by Congress last week. Congress has a responsibility to pass 12 separate appropriations bills by September 30. This year's appropriations bill was three months overdue. While the process was flawed, we should not continue to leave our military at level funding by delaying this legislation even longer - especially with the growing threat of China and Russia. This bill provides our men and women in uniform and their families with a 4.6 percent pay increase to help military families contend with the current record-high inflation and help recruitment numbers. At a time when our military is facing serious challenges in recruitment and retention, these additional resources to our military are more critical than ever. The appropriations bill spends more on defense than non-defense, and in fact non-defense spending decreased [in real dollars] from last year. We provide more money for defense and less money for other government programs than President Biden requested in his 2023 budget. This bill was also successful in adding a number of provisions that advance the cause of those who served our nation. By including the Joseph Maxwell Cleland and Robert Joseph Dole Memorial Veterans Benefits Improvement Act (Cleland-Dole Act) and the STRONG Veterans Act in the appropriations bill, we were able to make important changes to the way veterans receive benefits and health care. This appropriations bill was past due, but the process begins in early 2023 for next year's appropriations bill. We have an opportunity to work with the new Republican House majority to reduce spending. That opportunity begins in a few weeks. I spoke about the appropriations bill on the Senate floor last week. To watch the floor speech, click here . Urging My Colleagues to Advance the Afghan Adjustm ent Act This week, I spoke on the Senate floor to urge my colleagues to advance the Afghan Adjustment Act . The chaotic evacuation from Kabul stranded thousands of our Afghan allies behind enemy lines. Veterans are calling for Congress to help our allies and friends who assisted them in battle. We must answer that call and make the Afghan Adjustment Act a top priority next Congress. You can watch my full remarks here . Kansas Community Visits Pike Valley High School I visited Pike Valley High School in Scandia to speak with the school administration and to receive a tour from students. It was great to hear from these young Kansans about their fall semester as they prepared for winter break. Thank you to Principal Jeremy Miller for hosting. Courtland I enjoyed visiting Courtland this week and speaking with folks from the community during my stops in town. Thank you for the warm welcome from those at Bostwick Irrigation District, Swedish American State Bank, Courtland Coworking with North 40 Architecture, Little Hometown Graphic Design, JenRus Freelance Marketing, Ag Marketing Partners, Republic County Economic Development, Bestifor Farms, City Hall and Courtland Community Library.

136," News from Representative Larson Dear Friends, As the 117th Congress comes to a close, I am proud of what we've accomplished together for Connecticut's First District and the nation. Here are some of the highlights: My team has helped constituents resolve issues with federal agencies, opening nearly 2,800 cases, sending out more than 60,000 constituent responses, and securing more than $350 million in federal grant funding. 17 bills I cosponsored became law this year, including bipartisan legislation to increase supply and lower the cost of baby formula, helping to ease a devastating shortage. Our Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, slashing health care premiums on the Access Health CT exchange, and reducing energy bills for homeowners, while dramatically reducing the federal deficit. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we passed the American Rescue Plan , a relief package that put vaccines in arms, kids back in school, money in people's wallets, and America back to work. I fought for direct aid to all 27 towns and cities in the district's recovery efforts, more than $567 million in total. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law , our nation's largest infrastructure investment, was passed by Congress, sending more than $6 billion to Connecticut. I advocated for funding that is being put to work to advance the Hartford 400 vision to fix the I-84/91 interchange, expand multi-modal transit options, and achieve a 50-year goal of recapturing the riverfront. We passed the Honoring Our PACT Act , the largest expansion of veterans' benefits in decades. This legislation expanded VA health care eligibility to Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans and offered new benefits and strengthened coverage for toxic-exposed veterans. I will continue to be your advocate in Washington and look forward to serving in the new Congress.

137," News from Congressman Brian Mast ABOUT GET HELP NEWS CONTACT YEAR IN REVIEW: WATER WINS   - There is not a single issue that I hear more about from folks in our community than the fight for clean water. It's something that I work on every single day. Some days there are small victories, and others there are big wins. Thankfully, this year, we had some HUGE wins. The Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) which included several initiatives that I authored, including the Northern Estuaries Restoration Plan (NERP), is going to make an impact for generations to come. On top of that, my bill, the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act, is now law and will require the federal government to develop an action plan to combat toxic algae that's specific to South Florida. I'm excited by what we've accomplished this year, and ready to get back in the fight in the new Congress!

138," For Immediate Release December 27, 2022 Reflecting on my Second Year in Congress As this year comes to an end, I've taken time to reflect on my first term in the United States Congress. Two years ago, I came to Washington as the Freshman Class President eager to learn and lead. Although, we were in the minority, and under different circumstances due to COVID-19 shutdowns and protocols, it's been exciting to witness the People's House slowly come back to life. I've been able to have productive constituent meetings in Washington while also visiting dozens of organizations around Oklahoma's Fifth District. These conversations have helped craft my legislative agenda, aided my community outreach, and allowed me to effectively communicate with my constituents. In addition, I have had the ability to break through bureaucratic red tape and solve casework issues with federal agencies. Whether in Washington or the district, it's been an honor to deliver results for my fellow Oklahomans. I was proud to serve on two great committees in my first term - the House Armed Services and Science, Space, and Technology Committees. These committees helped me develop great legislative solutions for Oklahoma's Fifth, especially when it came to the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA. I was able to secure over 30 provisions in this year's NDAA, including protections for the E-3 wing at Tinker Air Force Base, $301 million to accelerate the transition to the E-7, and $30 million for Tinker's B-21 Depot Maintenance Campus. Additionally, I fought hard to repeal Biden's unlawful vaccine mandate, which was negatively affecting military retention and recruiting. I was also proud to have my bill, the NOAA Weather Radio Act, pass the House. As we know, Oklahoma is no stranger to severe weather, and this critical legislation seeks to modernize and provide access to this reliable and effective lifesaving service for every citizen. Overall, I introduced 21 bills and cosponsored more than 250 bills with the priorities of my constituents top-of-mind. Although producing effective legislation is important, my main priority in Congress is to meet the daily needs of Oklahomans through impactful constituent services. My office has helped nearly 400 constituents solve issues with federal agencies, including social security, Medicare, the VA, and the IRS. Additionally, I have sent nearly 600,000 outreach messages to constituents in this year alone. I'm grateful to hear directly from people like you so I can better serve Oklahomans in Congress. There are a lot of issues that need to be resolved next year, and under a Republican majority in the House, we are ready to get to work. Thankfully, we will be able to halt the reckless agenda of House Democrats. However, with a Democratic Senate and Democratic President, we will need to find areas that we can work on together to solve issues. It is of utmost importance that we restore American energy independence, hold the Biden Administration accountable for their lack of focus on our southern border, bolster our national security, and get our economy back on track. My colleagues and I have actionable legislation to do just that. Also, I'm fortunate to have a seat at the leadership table after being elected to serve on the Elected Leadership Committee on behalf of my sophomore class. This will further ensure the voices of Oklahomans are a part of the conversation that drives the future of our nation. ﻿ It's an absolute honor to represent you in Congress. Each year, I will always strive to better serve the people of Oklahoma's Fifth Congressional District. I wish each and every one of you a safe and happy new year. ### Media Contact: Wesley Harkins: 202-225-2132 Rep.

139," News from Representative Himes Dear Friends, As 2022 comes to a close, I want to take a few moments to reflect on what we accomplished together this past year. I am proud to say that despite the divisive times we are in, the House managed to get a lot of work done this year. Hearing From You Hearing from constituents is the most important part of my job as a Member of Congress. After the coronavirus pandemic put large gatherings on pause, it was especially gratifying to once again have the opportunity to hold in-person town halls across the district and hear from you directly. Please know you can always reach me or my staff members at my Bridgeport office at (203) 333-6600 or my Stamford office at (203) 353-9400. Delivering for the Fourth District Securing federal funding for projects in our community remains a priority of mine. In March of 2022, I was proud to have fought for and won almost $12.4 million for ten local community projects. From building new sidewalks in Norwalk and Stamford to expanding a safe house for victims of domestic violence, these investments will make our communities even better places to live, work, and raise a family. Just last week, Congress passed a government funding bill that included nearly $24 million for an additional fourteen projects in the district. These funds are an investment not only in our state's infrastructure, but in our women-owned businesses, our recovering veterans, our district's working families, our schoolchildren, and many more. Advancing Southwest Connecticut's Priorities Every town hall, I hear from a constituent concerned about rising health care costs, and rightfully so. Americans pay ten times more for insulin than citizens of other developed nations. With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, starting in 2023 the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for Medicare beneficiaries will be capped at no more than $35 for a month's supply. This legislation will bring down the cost of other drugs as well. The U.S. government will start negotiating with pharmaceutical companies, saving billions of dollars for Medicare beneficiaries. The Inflation Reduction Act did more than lower health care costs - it was also the largest investment in fighting climate change the United States has ever made. The Fourth District is home to several beautiful, coastal towns, and the memory of hurricane devastation is still fresh. This legislation allocates $2.6 billion for projects to protect coastal communities like ours from extreme storms and build more resilient infrastructure. Congress also tackled American innovation, research and manufacturing with the CHIPS and Science Act. This legislation is creating a pipeline for a stronger, more diverse domestic manufacturing workforce, while also supporting Connecticut companies like ASML in Wilton which makes the machines that produce microchips. Honoring our Promise to Veterans Voting for the PACT Act was one of my proudest moments in Congress this year. The veterans who risked their lives for this country deserve our utmost respect, support, and care. The PACT Act means that America is finally keeping its promise to those who sacrificed so much in the line of duty by expanding and extending healthcare eligibility for veterans with toxic exposures. To find out if you or someone you know might be eligible for these benefits, visit . Making our Community Safer The passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act marked the first time in three decades that Congress was able to advance significant legislation addressing America's epidemic of gun violence. While there is still work to be done, this commonsense legislation is a meaningful step toward protecting our communities. Among its critical provisions, it requires enhanced under-21 background checks, invests in state crisis intervention programs, and provides nearly $15 billion in new funding to grow, strengthen, and improve mental health services in our schools and communities. Protecting Fundamental Rights I was very proud to stand with Americans across the country and vote to defend marriage equality. The Respect for Marriage Act protects same-sex and interracial marriages, ensuring long-term stability for these families by providing important statutory protections under federal law. I will continue to fight for the safety, dignity, and rights of all Americans. This year also saw the Supreme Court overturn almost 50 years of precedent set by Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs v. Jackson case. Though the House acted decisively time and time again to protect a woman's right to choose, inaction in the Senate has left too many women without the ability to access an abortion. I will continue to fight to ensure that women have the right to make their own healthcare decisions. Strengthening American Democracy In 2020, we saw a serious attempt to subvert America's democracy and overturn the results of a free and fair election. The Vice President's role in the transition of power is widely understood to be purely ministerial. Elections are decided by the will of the people - not state legislators, or the Vice President. Last week I voted to pass the Electoral Count Act, which eliminates ambiguity in our system and strengthens the core element of our democracy: the people's voices. Wrapping Up 2022 It is always an honor to serve you in Congress, and I'm deeply grateful that so many of you have reached out to share your perspective this year. I hope you will continue to stay in touch through a call, email or letter in the new year. Wishing you and your family a wonderful holiday season and a happy New Year!

140," News from Rep. Chip Roy CONTACT ABOUT ISSUES MEDIA SERVICES Dear  , As I begin another busy week in Texas after relaxing with my family over Christmas, I wanted to pass along my latest update on what I have been doing to fight for you, Texas' 21st Congressional district, and our country as a whole: Fighting Dems' last-ditch omnibus spending spree Last week, I spoke on the House floor twice in fervent opposition of lame duck Democrats' last-ditch $1.7 trillion, 4,100-page omnibus bill. This bill was unveiled at 1:30am two days before the final vote in the House, and will increase spending by $118 billion. The omnibus bill includes 45 billion dollars for the country of Ukraine - 21 percent over President Biden's request. It also includes $15 billion for 7,234 earmarks - pet projects funneling money to all manner of worthless and often harmful projects (I compiled a list of some of the worst earmarks here) And it funds a whole alphabet soup of federal agencies that are demonstrably not doing their jobs and are instead targeting the American people. Before the vote, I introduced several amendments to the omnibus bill that would have done the following: Defund the Department of Defense's abortion travel fund Prohibit the Department of Veterans Affairs from funding abortion or abortion related travel Cut Internal Revenue Service funding by $7.7 billion Defund the so-called Respect for Marriage Act Defund the World Health Organization Defund the UN Office of Population Affairs Defund the United Nations Population Fund Defund climate envoy John Kerry Defund the Department of Defense's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Office Defund the Department of Energy's Office of Economic Impact and Diversity Defund the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Defund ""environmental justice"" activities at the Environmental Protection Agency Unfortunately, the Rules committee rejected all of my amendments. As you can imagine, I voted no on the bill. You can read my full statement on voting against the omnibus bill by clicking here. You can watch my floor speeches by clicking here and here . Challenging unconstitutional proxy voting After the vote on the omnibus bill, I challenged the constitutionality of allowing more than half of the votes on it to be cast by proxy. There were over 220 proxy votes cast on the $1.7 trillion omnibus in the final hours before Christmas, which created a lack of a physical quorum as the Constitution requires. You can watch a clip of me speaking on the floor about proxy voting by clicking here. Here are some news stories about what I've been up to lately: Chip Roy blows up over $1.7T spending bill in fiery floor speech: 'Destroying the United States' Chip Roy takes aim at omnibus bill full of 'woke garbage' Millions for Gender, Equity, Climate Projects Included in the Omnibus Bill GOP Blasts Biden Admin Over 'Reckless' Reversal of Title 42, Warns of 'Full-Scale Invasion' Democrats Have Meltdown Over Being Called Out by Rep. Roy for Earmarks in $1.7 Trillion Omnibus EXCLUSIVE: Rep. Chip Roy Unveils Amendments To Slash Green, Woke Handouts In Congress' Massive Spending Bill Rep. Chip Roy introduces spending bill amendment to defund Respect for Marriage Act Exclusive: Rep. Chip Roy to Offer Omnibus Amendment to Defund DOD's Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Rep. Chip Roy pushes to slash IRS funding by $7.7 billion in spending bill Passport resources The State Department is encouraging passport applications and renewals during the off-peak travel season in fall or winter because demand is lower and processing is faster. Please remember to check your passport expiration date and keep in mind some countries require your passport to be valid for six months after your visit. You can find information on how to apply or renew your passport here . USDA Wildfire and Drought Resources The US Department of Agriculture offers several resources available to farmers and ranchers impacted by the recent wildfires and drought in Texas. We encourage you to take advantage of this federal assistance if eligible. Resources for wildfire and drought recovery and risk management are available here and here , respectively.

141," Gosar Statement Regarding Biden's Holiday News Dump on November Border Crossings Gosar Statement Regarding Biden's Holiday News Dump on November Border Crossings Contact Me | Media Center | Our District For Immediate Release Contact: Anthony Foti Date: December 27, 2022 @ Gosar Statement Regarding Biden's Holiday News Dump on November Border Crossings Prescott, AZ - Congressman Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ-04) issued the following statement after the Biden regime released new data showing that a record 233,740 illegal aliens illegally crossed the southern border in November 2022, making it the worst November on record. ""On Christmas weekend and mere hours after Congress shamelessly passed the $1.7 trillion omnibus bill sending billions of dollars to foreign countries for border security, the Biden regime announced that 233,740 illegals crossed our border last month. To put this into perspective, that is enough lawbreakers to fill State Farm Stadium, home of the Arizona Cardinals, more than 3.5 times. Things are only going to get worse. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) projects 14,000 illegals per day, or 420,000 per month, will soon cross the southern border once Title 42 orders expire. In 2018, nearly 30 million illegal aliens were living in the United States, according to a study conducted by Yale University. Since Biden took office, DHS reports another five million lawbreakers have crossed into our country bringing the total number of illegals currently living in America to over 35 million. That number is likely much higher when factoring in chain migration, ""gotaways"" and the significant undercounting of illegal aliens. Sadly, Senate democrats and even some Republicans are renewing their calls to grant amnesty to millions of people living in America illegally. This is lunacy. Amnesty only serves to encourage illegals to stay in the United States while simultaneously green lighting more to cross our southern border. It's abundantly clear that Joe Biden and democrats in Congress are intent on allowing as many illegal aliens as possible into our country. Rather than considering amnesty legislation for lawbreakers, Republicans in Congress must fight to secure our border and it begins with impeaching Department of Homeland Secretary Mayorkas for his failures to secure the border and protect Americans , "" concluded Congressman Gosar. ### ### Website |   | Contact Me Share on Facebook | Share on Twitter Washington, DC Office 2057 Rayburn HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-2315 Kingman 220 N. 4th Street Kingman , AZ 86401 (By Appointment Only) Prescott 122 N.

142," Sen. Rick Scott Continues to Fight for our Military and Veterans, Celebrates NDAA Passage ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ NEWS ALERT! Sen. Rick Scott Continues to Fight for our Military and Veterans, Celebrates NDAA Passage Sen. Rick Scott Celebrates NDAA Passage, Big Wins for Florida's Military Bases Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the U.S. Senate passed the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) . This year's NDAA includes $857.9 billion in defense spending, $45 billion more than President Joe Biden's inadequate budget request which did not keep up with his inflation crisis, and a rescission of the Pentagon's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for service members. Senator Scott continues to fight to ensure that service member who were unfairly discharged have the opportunity to be reinstated with backpay. Senator Rick Scott said, ""Florida is home to 21 military bases and three unified commands, and proud of the important and strategic role we play in America's national defense. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I fought hard this year to make sure the Sunshine State, America's national security initiatives, our military, veterans and their families got big wins in this NDAA. Since coming to the Senate four years ago, I've consistently advocated for major investments in our defense capabilities and to support Florida's military bases and our military families. The NDAA that passed the Senate today is a huge improvement over President Biden's woefully inadequate defense budget proposal and a great win for Florida, America's national security and our military community, but there is still work to do. While I'm glad this NDAA rescinds the Pentagon's COVID-19 vaccine mandate, I will continue to fight so that every service member who was wrongfully discharged has the opportunity to be reinstated with backpay."" Senator Scott fought for and secured several measures in the FY 2023 NDAA, including: $857.9 billion in national defense spending - $45 billion more than President Joe Biden's inadequate budget request; A rescission of the Pentagon's COVID-19 vaccine mandate amid the massive recruiting crisis; A 4.6% pay raise for military service members; $635 million for construction projects, training facilities and access to childcare on Florida's military bases; $208 million for U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), including an assessment of SOUTHCOM's ability to detect, and interdict illicit narcotics and weapons trafficking activities; An audit to improve living quarters for Coast Guard enlisted families in Key West; A Wounded Warrior Bill of Rights to ensure due process and proper care for all service members who have been wounded or fallen ill; Upgraded long-range drone technology and long-range munitions to combat our enemies; Measures to prevent the Department of Defense from acquiring equipment from adversaries, like Communist China; and Continued military support to enhance cooperation with America's strategic allies, including Israel and Taiwan.

Rick Scott, 10 Colleagues Urge Pentagon to Freeze COVID-19 Vaccine-Related Discharges, Reinstate Discharged Soldiers with Backpay Following the Senate's approval of the National Defense Authorization act (NDAA), Senator Rick Scott led his colleagues in a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. The Senators urged Secretary Austin to freeze all COVID-19 vaccine-related discharges, and to establish a quick and thorough process so all members who were discharged because they refused the COVID-19 vaccine can be reinstated with back pay and full benefits. Senators James Lankford, Mike Braun, John Hoeven, Jim Risch,   Graham, Mike Crapo, Mike Lee, Josh Hawley, Ron Johnson and Marco Rubio all co-signed the letter. Read the full letter HERE or below. December 16, 2022 The Honorable Lloyd Austin Secretary U.S. Department of Defense 1000 Defense Pentagon Washington, D.C. 20301 Dear Secretary Austin: Now that the Senate has passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the legislation heads to President Biden's desk to be signed into law. This year's NDAA, which provides essential funding and sets defense and national security policy for the United States, also contains a key provision we fought for which eliminates the requirement for service members to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. While we are proud to see this needed change included, simply reversing the COVID-19 vaccine mandate is insufficient to right the wrongs done to our service members. We write today to urge immediate action from the Pentagon to protect our service members and provide much-needed direction and stability for America's brave heroes and their families. On December 7th, NBC News cited senior military and defense officials in its reporting that discussions about allowing the reinstatement of service members discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine are underway at the Pentagon. [1] This is welcome news. The Pentagon must take every action necessary to undo the harm American service members and their families suffered when they were forcibly discharged from service. We urge you to establish a quick and thorough process so all members who were discharged because they refused the COVID-19 vaccine can be reinstated with back pay and full benefits. Doing so would provide the clarity and stability American service members and their families deserve. Additionally, we urge you to freeze all COVID-19 vaccine-related discharges. Many service members are in limbo, and are facing discharge for their refusal to take the COVID-19 vaccine just as Congress is removing the vaccine requirement. As the Secretary of Defense, you have the power to immediately end the uncertainty these members are feeling. All branches of our military are facing significant recruiting problems, including problems arising from the vaccine requirement. Therefore, it is in our readiness and security interests to keep these brave men and women within our ranks. Moving forward with discharges over a requirement that has been rescinded by Congress would be deeply misguided. Thousands of brave men and women were harmed because of the Pentagon's misguided approach to the COVID-19 vaccine requirement. You have the opportunity to immediately begin undoing the harm caused. For the current and future morale and benefit our Armed Forces, we urge you to act immediately. We appreciate your attention, and look forward to clarity from the Pentagon on this important issue.

146," Counting down top accomplishments over a decade of service Dear friend, I've always been proud to represent the many wonderful towns and cities in our Congressional District, including Peoria - a vibrant community with a growing economy and beautiful riverfront. It's also home to the 61605 ZIP Code, one of the most distressed ZIP Codes in the nation. The 61605 community faces challenges that impact the people who live there every single day. A food desert with limited access to health care providers, the only pharmacy in this neighborhood shut its doors last year. During one visit, a resident shared with me that in order to make a quick run to the grocery store, she had to ride the bus for 16 stops each way. And if the bus wasn't running or she got home late from work, she was simply out of luck. External factors, such as access to fresh fruits and vegetables, the ability to regularly see a doctor and even having a safe and secure home can affect how healthy we are and how long we live. Public health experts call these factors the social determinants of health, and towns of all sizes, in every corner of our region and across the nation, face similar challenges. That's why I introduced the bipartisan Social Determinants Accelerator Act , to empower local leaders with the tools they need to create healthier communities. It's also why I established a first-of-its-kind pilot program for communities to address the social factors that harm long-term health . Since its launch, Peoria, Rockford and Eagle View in Northern, Northwest and Central Illinois have received $125,000 each through this program. And in the last session of Congress, I established the first Congressional Social Determinants of Health Caucus . As co-Chair, I've worked with a bipartisan group of my colleagues to build a healthier future for everyone, no matter where you live. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of leaders on every level, we're making significant strides to help communities across our nation, and I'm proud to have been part of making a real difference in the lives of the people I serve.

We are so blessed here in the United States and it is a privilege to be able to celebrate the birth of Jesus during this Christmas season. NO on $1.7 Trillion Bloated Omnibus Spending Bill The American people sent a message by electing a Republican majority in the House. It's time for fiscal responsibility and pro-growth policies that will restore economic strength. While I am pleased language from my bill, the Foreign Merger Subsidy Disclosure Act, to allow antitrust regulators to follow the money when countries like China distort markets and harm competition, the process and substance of a last-minute omnibus bill are reckless. To pass a bloated spending bill, just days before the new Congress, gives Democrats the ability to keep their imprudent policies in place well into next year. I voted NO .

149," News from ​Congresswoman Kathy Manning Home About Contact Media Resources Dear  , Happy New Year! As your Representative, I want to keep you updated on what I have done in Congress to serve the people of North Carolina's Sixth District.

The American Rescue Plan helped businesses keep their doors open and employees on payroll, delivered COVID-19 vaccines to millions of Americans, supported child care centers, and implemented the Child Tax Credit, which provided tax cuts for hardworking families in North Carolina's Sixth District. Inflation Reduction Act: Cutting Health Care Costs and Expanding Health Care Coverage Congresswoman Manning is committed to lowering costs for North Carolinians. That's why Congresswoman Manning voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which lowers health care and home energy costs for hardworking families and seniors in North Carolina. The Inflation Reduction Act expands health care coverage to an estimated 135,000 North Carolinians. 1 United Health Care Centers presented Congresswoman Manning with an award for her work to support health care workers in Congress. As of January 1, 2023, the Inflation Reduction Act will: Cap the cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare at $35/month. Expand Affordable Care Act subsidies for an additional three years for about 670,000 North Carolinians with Marketplace coverage. 1 This saves those North Carolinians an average of about $760 annually from the American Rescue Plan subsidies that the Inflation Reduction Act continues. 1 Address the high cost of prescription medications by finally allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for high-cost prescription drugs. Honoring Our PACT Act Congresswoman Manning helped to pass the Honoring Our PACT Act, legislation that delivers health care benefits to millions of veterans, and their survivors, who were exposed to toxins during their time of service in the United States Armed Forces.

152," Weekly Script December 26th, 2022 WEEKLY SC ℞ IPT Friends, Thank you for taking time to read my weekly update. Below you'll learn more about what I'm doing in Washington to support Iowans in the second district. Visit My Website Visit to Taiwan This week I joined Representative John Curtis (UT-03), Burgess Owens (UT-04), and Michelle Steel (CA-48) on a Congressional delegation trip to Taiwan to discuss national security, energy security, and Taiwan's role in the global supply chain. While there, we were able to meet the President, Vice President, and several cabinet members to reaffirm our commitment to a strong United States-Taiwan friendship. Legislative Roundup With the 118th Congress quickly approaching, I have signed onto Representative Jim Baird's (IN-04) VA Same-Day Scheduling Act. This legislation guarantees that any veteran who makes a phone call requesting care through the VA is able to schedule an appointment during the phone call. Happy Holidays As the holiday season comes to a close, I hope that everyone across Southeast Iowa has enjoyed a happy and safe holiday surrounded by friends and family, and I wish everyone a happy New Year! Sincerely, Dr. Mariannette Miller-Meeks Be sure to follow me on Twitter , Facebook , Instagram , and YouTube for more updates. ### Rep.

153," 96 Dear Friends, Just in time for Christmas, the House of Representatives passed a massive funding package on Friday afternoon that will dictate our government's spending for fiscal year 2023. This package of 12 bills provides $1.7 trillion in discretionary funding, including $800 billion in non-defense funding-the highest level for non-defense funding ever-plus $858 billion in defense funding. Of course, passing legislation of this scale takes a significant amount of compromise. There are many provisions that I championed that were left out, and others included that I disagree with. Nevertheless, t his is critical to keeping our government running so that it can serve the needs of the American people. Below are some of the highlights that reflect my priorities in Congress. I hope you are having a happy and healthy holiday season, from my family to yours. I'm thrilled to share that the 6th District will receive nearly $17 million in funding spread across fourteen local community improvement initiatives . These projects improve healthcare, environmental resilience, economic mobility, infrastructure, senior services, and more across the North Shore. Projects with secured funding include: $1 million for the Lynn Senior Center, $1 million for the Peabody Riverwalk, $2 million for Gloucester's Water Pollution Control Facility, and $1 million for the City of Beverly's Public Library HVAC system. Key Mental Health & Healthcare Provisions: $500 million in funding -a nearly $400 million increase-for the Suicide Prevention Lifeline to successfully transition to 988 as the nationwide mental health emergencies hotline. 20% funding boost to develop countermeasures against future pandemics and rebuild stockpiles of drugs, masks and other supplies. $130 million for Children's Mental Health Services and $111 million for programs designed to increase the availability of mental health services in schools. Historic funding for the critical Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting initiative, which improves health outcomes for pregnant people and young families who live in underserved communities. Permanent, mandatory, and continuous coverage for the 40 million children enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Defense & National Security $21 billion increase for veterans' health care $45 billion in economic and military aid to Ukraine Better mental health training for providers to service members and veterans Pay increase for all military personnel and civilians More than $2 billion in investments for clean energy and climate adaptation to protect facilities, readiness, and global security. Other Wins Include: Food Security: $28.5 billion in funding for child nutrition programs. Emergency Relief: Emergency disaster support to help victims of hurricanes and wildfires throughout our country, to address the water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, and $1 billion for Puerto Rico's electrical grid. Protecting Democracy: Reforms the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which will help thwart future attempts to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power like we saw on January 6th. Education: The maximum Pell grant award increases by $500 to $7,395 to help millions of students, many from lower-income families, to afford college. Water Infrastructure: $10.6 billion for water infrastructure throughout the country. Combatting Homelessness: $3.6 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants which will serve over 1 million people experiencing homelessness each year through a wide variety of service and housing interventions. Affordable Housing: $1.5 billion for construction of nearly 10,000 new affordable rental and homebuyer units. Public Safety: $700 million for Violence Against Women Act prevention and prosecution programs and $45 million in grants to prevent and respond to hate crimes-nearly double the 2022 level. Science & Research: $10 billion in funding for the National Science Foundation, the largest dollar increase ever for the agency. Enhanced Retirement Savings: New retirement rules that could make it easier for Americans to accumulate retirement savings. Coasts and Climate: $1 million for my Young Fishermen's Development Act, and more funding for North Atlantic Right Whale-related research, monitoring, enforcement, and conservation efforts. What I'm Still Fighting For As the 117th Congress ends and the 118th begins in a couple weeks, I will return to Washington ready to fight both for the 6th District and for important national priorities. Here are just a few: Immigration: It is absolutely critical that Congress work out a solution to our broken immigration system. We need a deal that gives DACA recipients a clear pathway to citizenship, fixes our broken asylum system, and builds a better resourced, more effective border security system. This includes getting the Afghan Adjustment Act reintroduced and passed, to give Afghans who resettled in the U.S. a pathway to permanent residency. We also must create a permanent Special Immigrant Visa system so that the U.S. can help more of our Afghan allies left behind last summer. Mental Health: The launch of 988 was just the beginning. I will be working hard to expand mental health resources in America -- for both civilians and our service members. Mental healthcare should become as commonplace as physical healthcare. Energy Independence: We need a long-term, diverse energy independence strategy that eliminates our dependence on foreign oil. All options should be on the table. Affordable Housing & Transit: We are reaching a crisis state for affordable housing in Massachusetts and across the country. We need solutions so that hard-working families can simply afford housing. This includes better rail and public transit options, including regional and high-speed rail, which will ultimately connect communities and transform the way we think about housing. Defending Ukraine and Deterring China: We must learn the lessons of Ukraine and apply them to China if we're to deter any sort of conflict over Taiwan. The stakes are extremely high, and I will continue working from my position on the Armed Services Committee to pursue smart, 21st century policies on China. China is our greatest competitor, and we need to make some changes to out-compete them without getting into a war. All the best, Rep.

155," A message from Congresswoman Ann Wagner About Contact Services Media Center Issues Dear , Merry Christmas! I hope you and those close to you had a wonderful day full of joy and Christmas cheer. May God bless you and your family. Last week, the Democrats in the House rammed through a massive spending bill full of liberal, special interest funding. This $1.7 trillion bill is over four thousand pages long and was introduced at the last minute, giving us no time to adequately review all its provisions. It even includes funding for Maine lobsters, to create a Salmon Research Task Force, and $175 million for Lake Champlain in Vermont, along with 3,200 Democrat earmarks worth over $5 billion. This is not the right way to legislate, and I am sick of the Democrat leadership's incompetence. When Republicans have the majority in January, we will hit the ground running, ready to govern. The Financial Services Committee held a hearing where we questioned the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Rohit Chopra. The CFPB has clearly chosen to regulate by press release, guidance, and enforcement action instead of through the traditional Administrative Procedure Act (APA) process. This is completely unacceptable and calls into question whether these guidelines are legally enforceable. Watch my full questioning here . My office held an awards ceremony and reception for the Congressional App Challenge where we recognized this year's winners and participants. Every year I am impressed by the talent, hard work, and ingenuity our students bring to the table, and I cannot wait to see how they impact the world. Congratulations to this year's winners of the 2nd District Congressional App Challenge, Emily and Serena Huang from Parkway Central! Their winning app is called Lively: Daily Planner and Journal. Thank you to LaunchCode and The Coder School for supporting the Congressional App Challenge and helping students improve their coding skills. We held a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on the importance of the Caucasus region and Putin's constant attempts to exert power in the area. For decades, Russia's influence across the Caucasus has exacerbated tensions and hampered growth. Yet Putin's abhorrent invasion of Ukraine has weakened Russia's ability to project power in the region. The U.S. must act now to roll back Russian influence, promote democratic governance, and work to heal longstanding conflicts. Watch my full set of remarks here .

156," News from Representative Kilmer Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window Click here to open a plain text version of this email WEBSITE BIOGRAPHY SERVICES MEDIA CENTER ISSUES CONTACT December 26, 2022 Hello Folks - I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday weekend! It was great to spend time with my family, share some presents and eggnog, and binge-watch Hallmark holiday movies. As we move into the New Year, I hope folks have a happy and healthy 2023, filled with prosperity and new opportunities! I'm also looking forward to another year as your representative. I'm honored to work for you! OK - on to the news. Puget SOS Act As folks may recall, the representative from our neighboring district (Marilyn Strickland) and I introduced the PUGET SOS Act to enhance the federal government's role in the restoration and recovery of Puget Sound. The Sound is our region's most iconic body of water, where generations of friends and neighbors have built their lives and made their livelihoods. But if future generations are going to enjoy those same opportunities, we must act. I'm excited to report that this bill was recently signed into law by President Biden (as part of a larger piece of legislation). I've been fighting since day one to make the federal government a better partner in Puget Sound recovery. Together, with Rep. Strickland, the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus, and our partners throughout the region, we got this done to restore salmon and orca populations, ensure future generations can dig for clams, uphold tribal treaty rights, and so much more. The bill will establish a Puget Sound Recovery National Program Office at the Environmental Protection Agency to coordinate protection and restoration efforts of the nation's largest estuary by volume. I'm also excited to report that the government spending bill that passed the House on Friday includes a record $54 million for cleaning up Puget Sound. This is a huge step in the right direction, and I am proud to have helped lead the charge on this effort. Securing Investments for Our Region As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I have the opportunity to play a meaningful role in helping to shape the investments our government makes. It's an opportunity to support investments for our region that will create jobs and support the communities I serve. Just last week, Congress passed a new spending package for 2023. I supported this bill because it will provide a much-needed pay increase for our service members and our civilian Defense workers, because it strengthens veterans' health care, and because it invests in affordable housing and keeping our communities and our environment healthy and safe. I was also able to secure some important wins for our region in the final government spending package, with more than $35 million in federal funding allocated to all 15 of the local proposals submitted by my office earlier this year. I know that this will go a long way in meeting the long-overdue needs of our region. This investment by the federal government will help folks create jobs with better pay, make folks safer, strengthen our communities, and fight back against climate change. Here's an overview of some of the projects that will make a real difference: Supporting New Affordable Housing and Community Facilities in Jefferson County Across our region, we need more affordable housing. But that's only going to get built if we have the infrastructure needed to support it. That's why I'm proud that the government spending package just passed by Congress included funding for two important infrastructure projects in Jefferson County that can help us provide the services needed to build new housing and service residents at essential community locations. Congress advanced new funding I advocated for to help build a new sewer pump station to service the Evans Vista neighborhood in Port Townsend. That investment will support the community-based development of 100-150 mixed-income affordable and workforce housing units. In addition, I secured funding for a sewer project in Port Hadlock - enabling connections to the Chimacum Primary School and the Public Library and enabling the development of new affordable, multi-family housing, senior housing, and small businesses. It's good progress that can help our region build much-needed housing in Jefferson County! Assisting Folks in Need in the South Sound There are far too many folks in our region who are experiencing homelessness. Not only do we need to increase housing affordability and accessibility, but we also need to help folks get back on their feet and make ends meet. That means we've got to ensure that the shelter and services people need are readily available. That's why I've been pushing to get the City of Tacoma and the Tacoma Rescue Mission more funding to help them expand. I'm thrilled that the federal government advanced new funding I advocated for to help expand the Tacoma Rescue Mission - which will increase permanent shelter capacity, inclement weather shelter capacity, addiction recovery services, and day-use space to provide critical wellness services such as workforce development, mental health services, and substance use counseling. Modernizing the Port of Grays Harbor & Supporting Local Fishermen Our coastal fisheries and seafood industry are an essential part of our region's economy. In fact, Westport Marina in Grays Harbor is the state's largest commercial seafood landing port - and is considered a port of ""national significance"" due to the volume and value of the catch that comes through it. That means it's a critical economic hub for tribal, commercial, charter, and recreational fishing on our coast - supporting nearly 2,300 jobs in its uplands. The new spending bill includes funding to help modernize the Westport Marina and support jobs and local economic opportunity. The funding will support the Marina's effort to modernize and reconfigure its floating dock so that it can adequately support the needs of the region's robust fishing fleet now - and serve the needs of our region long into the future. Economic Growth in Mason and Kitsap Counties As we work to recover from this pandemic, we've got to ensure that communities have the resources they need to attract new investment, create new jobs, and build local economies. That's why I was thrilled to secure funding for projects to help make that happen. In Mason County, a lack of electrical capacity and reliability issues continue to be a primary inhibitor to creating economic growth and attracting new businesses to the region. In fact, in 2021, the Economic Development Council of Mason County had to turn away multiple recruitment opportunities due to lack of electrical infrastructure capacity-resulting in an estimated loss of hundreds of potential new jobs. That's why I'm thrilled that Congress advanced new federal funding that I advocated for to help Mason County PUD 3 build out the essential electrical infrastructure they need to help attract new businesses and investment and increase regional grid resilience for existing customers. It's great news! In Kitsap County, downtown Port Orchard's Bay Street Corridor (Port Orchard's ""main street"") faces persistent flooding. So, as part of the city's master plan, they're working to redevelop the west end of downtown to include a Community Center, a new Kitsap Bank facility, Kitsap Regional Library, and Mixed-Use Housing projects. As part of that redesign, they're hoping to build a more resilient Bay Street that can better provide safe accommodation and efficiency in the downtown area (for all modes of transportation!). I'm thrilled that the bill that passed includes funding to advance the reconstruction of this area at a raised elevation that will account for persistent flooding and rising sea levels. It's an important piece of the effort to revitalize downtown Port Orchard - and will help catalyze the local economy. Improving Health Care and Increasing Affordable Housing for Tribal Communities Across our region, we need more affordable housing - including for Native communities. That's why I'm thrilled that Congress has advanced new federal funding to build new affordable housing on the Suquamish Tribe's Port Madison Indian Reservation and on the Skokomish Indian Tribe's Reservation. These projects will not only help ensure more Tribal members can return to their ancestral homelands, but also help ease housing challenges for non-Tribal citizens that live nearby these reservations. These investments are win-win for our region. In addition, we know that Native communities in our region and across our country have consistently struggled to deliver essential health services and programs to support reservation residents. The federal government has an obligation to fulfill its trust and treaty responsibilities and to make sure that people have the resources they need to live healthy lives. That's why I'm proud that Congress passed funding that I advocated for to help two Native American Tribes on the North Olympic Peninsula improve healthcare options for community members and ultimately strengthen health outcomes. The funding for the Makah Tribe will help the Tribe expand and relocate the critical medical services of the Sophie Trettevick Indian Health Center out of the Tsunami Inundation Zone and meet the needs of its growing population. And the funding for the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe will help the Tribe advance the planning and development phases of the Lower Elwha Klallam Health and Wellness Complex, which will provide access to a wide range of high-quality, culturally sensitive services for Tribal members, and additional health and social services to the broader community. Supporting Families and Children in Grays Harbor It's important to give kids a good start in school - and life. That's why I'm thrilled that Congress has advanced new federal funding I advocated for to assist critical programming that helps rural communities make school readiness programs and parent education opportunities accessible for all. The funding will support Save the Children's effort to accelerate academic achievement among the most marginalized children in rural Washington communities through early childhood home visiting programs, parent engagement workshops, home library builds to help build a culture of literacy, and mobile outreach providing nutritious meals to families in need. It's a big deal for families across our region! An Update to Community Project Funding With the passage of this year's spending bill, we will start gearing up for Community Project Funding requests for next year. I look forward to reviewing proposals from communities across our region. To evaluate the requests, I'll once again convene an independent advisory panel of local stakeholders to help inform the selection process and evaluate the degree to which the requests have strong community support, capture the geographic and demographic makeup of the district, and achieve at least one of following goals: Create sustained job growth and/or economic opportunity Address imminent threats to public health, safety, or the environment Promote equity and inclusion for underserved populations Fulfill unmet federal obligations, including treaty and trust responsibilities to Native American tribes For more information on last year's process in preparation for next year, you can find my previous FY2023 Community Project Funding request resource guide available here . Working for You Fighting to End Hunger I'm working to end hunger in our communities, but I can't do that without help from people like Michelle Douglas and her terrific team at Emergency Food Network. I met with the Emergency Food Network team - people connecting people to consistent, nutritious meals across Pierce County. Recognizing Our Scouts I had a great time earlier this month with Cub Scout Pack 202 to discuss my work in our community and how they can help build a better world. Our youth's tenacity and resiliency are an inspiration. And, as a former Scout, I'm grateful for their dedication to our community and to good citizenship! Taking Action Against Climate Change Thanks to the folks from the Citizens' Climate Lobby Bainbridge Island Chapter for meeting with me earlier this month. We discussed how provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act, both of which are now law, will help to safeguard Washington's environment for years to come. OK - that's it for now, folks. Here's to a Happy New Year! As always, I'm honored to represent you.

158," Wicker Calls For Big Tech Investigations Twitter Files Reveal Systematic Bias Against Conservatives The release of the Twitter Files will go down as a defining moment in the history of Big Tech. These internal files, aired in recent weeks with the permission of Twitter's new CEO Elon Musk, confirm Twitter's long history of bias against conservatives. The documents show that Twitter used ""shadow bans"" to suppress content they disagreed with, created double-standards for conservative users, and invented a pretext to suspend Donald Trump's account while he was still President. These explosive revelations show the enormous power that a handful of liberal tech executives have over our public discourse. We should be grateful that new leadership is lifting the hood on Twitter, but Congress needs to follow up with wider investigations into Big Tech companies, including Facebook and Google. Americans deserve to know the full extent of tech bias and corruption that is impacting our country. Left-Wing Groupthink Leads to Censorship Much of the rot at Big Tech companies comes from the sheer lack of viewpoint diversity among their staff. These companies are overwhelmingly left-wing. During the midterm elections, for example, more than 99 percent of all political donations from Twitter employees went to Democrats. This extreme one-sidedness is reflected in people like Yoel Roth, Twitter's former ""Head of Trust and Safety,"" who censored the New York Post 's reporting on Hunter Biden and likened members of the Trump Administration to Nazis. These Silicon Valley executives are out of touch with the rest of the country and are inclined to treat dissent as a form of heresy, often accusing conservatives of ""hate speech."" It is not hard to see how this rigid groupthink led to bias against conservatives, which continued through much of 2022. Earlier this year, the popular Christian satire site The Babylon Bee was suspended from Twitter for making a joke about transgenderism. A government official from Spain was locked out of his account for pointing out that ""a man cannot get pregnant."" A Missouri Congresswoman, Vicky Hartzler, was suspended after she tweeted: ""Women's sports are for women, not men pretending to be women,"" a comment that supposedly violated Twitter's policy against ""hateful content."" And as we now know from the Twitter Files, Stanford professor Dr. Jay Bhattachayra was shadow-banned on the platform simply for raising doubts about COVID policies. Meanwhile, Twitter never lifted a finger to suspend left-wing accounts associated with Antifa, a domestic terror group, or world leaders who openly threaten violence. Time to Investigate Big Tech We live in a big country where people hold a wide range of views and convictions. This diversity makes it all the more vital that we protect free speech. Big Tech has shown that it cannot be trusted to do so. Congress now has an obligation to act on behalf of the American people and bring transparency and accountability to these public platforms. Some lawmakers have been fearful of investigating these companies, citing the fact that they are free enterprises operating in a free market. What this fails to recognize is that these massive companies wield unprecedented power over our nation. Google's search algorithms determine what information we can find online. Facebook sells personal data to other companies, essentially turning millions of Americans into products. And decisions made by Twitter almost certainly affected the outcome of the 2020 election. All the while, these companies continue to enjoy special protections under the law that other businesses do not have. Congress needs to roll back those special carve-outs, as I sought to do with legislation when I led the Senate Commerce Committee. I look forward to supporting more of these efforts in 2023.

What's maddening is that they unveiled their massive, 4,000-plus page government funding bill just days earlier in the dark of night, leaving members of Congress too little time to research what's actually in it. READING HERE In Case you missed it It's shameful that House Ways and Means Democrats voted to release President Trump and his family's personal tax information - including a child's social security number. Washington Democrats aren't just closing a chapter in one of their many witch hunts against President Trump, they are also opening a new chapter which gives the incoming Republican majority authority to use similar tools to investigate whether President Biden and his family have enriched themselves off the Washington Democrats' agenda. CLICK HERE to watch me speak on the House floor fighting against their reckless actions. In their final moments in the majority, Washington Democrats passed a $2 trillion year-end spending bill that represents everything the American people can't stand about Washington: an over 4,000 page piece of legislation introduced in the dead of night that wastes billions of Americans' taxpayer dollars and will continue to fuel the worst cost-of-living crisis in 40 years.

I'm honored to have earned Americans for Prosperity's Pioneers for Prosperity Award for my efforts to stop the Left's reckless spending and radical agenda. As Budget Republican Leader, I've helped expose the trillions of dollars the Left has forced through Congress with their massive spending bills, whether it was giving out taxpayer subsidies to help rich people purchase new electric vehicles, forgiving the student loan debt of doctors and lawyers, or driving gas and utility costs to record highs by increasing taxes on U.S. energy.

Thanks to Republican efforts and President Trump's leadership, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act kept its promise to build a stronger, more prosperous nation where families and workers can chase the American Dream. The law was a huge win in particular for the working class: it cut taxes by more than $2,000 for the average family of 4 and it delivered bigger paychecks, more jobs, and more investment here in America.

As we gather this year to celebrate the birth of Jesus and the lessons of love he brought to the world, I want to wish each one of you a Merry Christmas. This joyous season is an opportune time to express our gratitude for the love we share with our friends and family and the countless blessings we enjoy. This year, I am a thankful for my wife Kristen and our three boys, our wonderful home in central Illinois, and the unbelievable privilege to represent central, west-central, and northern Illinois in Congress.

During the holiday season, however, it is important that we give thanks to those who sacrifice their time without their families and loved ones to protect us, particularly during another year that was challenging for so many. I want to thank our troops, especially those serving overseas far away from their families, who are protecting our country and the freedoms we enjoy. While this year was an economic challenge for many, I hope each of you takes solace in the blessing of living in the greatest country on earth and the community we share in Illinois. From our family to yours, Merry Christmas! I hope you have a holiday filled with joy and family.

Opposing the Pork-laden Democrat Omnibus On Friday, House Democrats rushed through a massive spending bill , to the tune of $1.65 trillion of taxpayer money. I voted against this disastrous bill that was born of a broken process and which does nothing to address the real issues facing our country: high inflation and a wide open southern border. This bad bill was only the latest example of Democrats putting their political priorities ahead of the American people.

169," Friends, I hope you all are having a very Merry Christmas and celebrating the holidays with your loved ones. My family and I wish you and yours peace, joy, and good health. Pushing Back Against Washington's Irresponsible Spending On Friday, the House wrapped up its legislative calendar for the year by passing a $1.7 trillion year-end spending package that will once again burden American families. Over the past two years, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrat majority have recklessly spent more than $3 trillion outside of the normal appropriations process. Their out-of-control spending has been a driving force behind the inflation pummeling Ohio families. Now more than ever, Congress needs to produce a responsible fiscal agenda that meets the needs of the American people. But instead, my Democrat colleagues crafted a spending package that will cost taxpayers nearly $2 trillion, contributing to further inflation and failing to meet the fundamental duty of securing our borders or lowering energy costs. This spending bill demonstrates that Washington has seriously misplaced priorities. As always, I have stood ready, willing, and able to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to produce a fiscally responsible spending package that prioritizes the needs of my constituents. While there are some parts of the legislation that I like and fought for, they do not justify voting for nearly $2 trillion of out-of-touch spending that will only make things harder for working families. It's sad that the Democrats waited until the last minute in an attempt to sideline the incoming majority. This type of governing is irresponsible. It is not what the American people want and it is the opposite of what they need. Ensuring Our Armed Forces Can Access the Benefits They Deserve I am proud to share that on Thursday, after passing both the Senate and House of Representatives, my bill, Sgt. Wolf Kyle Weninger Veterans Education Fairness Act of 2022, was sent to the President's desk to be signed into law. I introduced this legislation in May in honor of the late Sergeant Wolf Kyle Weninger, a U.S. Marine and OH-14 constituent who died tragically in a training exercise. The bill amends the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, commonly known as the new G.I. Bill, to ensure soldiers who are honorably discharged under the sole survivorship discharge distinction prior to completing three years of Active Duty service are still eligible to seek financial compensation for a college education. This ensures that service members like Sergeant Weninger's brother, who did nothing more than leave the Armed Forces early on a sole survivorship discharge in order to support his grieving family, aren't wrongfully denied education assistance under the G.I. Bill. ﻿My bill passed the House as part of H.R. 7939, the Student Veteran Emergency Relief Act on Thursday. Thank you to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who helped get this bill to the President's desk, and to the Weninger Family for their tireless dedication to our nation's servicemembers and veterans. It's only right to ensure those in our Armed Forces can access the benefits they've earned following the conclusion of their service. Combatting Chinese Surveillance in the U.S. The Chinese Communist Party is one of the largest threats facing our nation. Recently, there has been increased attention to Chinese companies' access and use of U.S. capital markets for their own advantage. It is absolutely critical that we protect U.S. national security and limit western capital from fueling Chinese Communist Party military and surveillance companies to ensure American investors are not funding China's advancement. That's why, I cosponsored H.R. 5326, the Chinese Military and Surveillance Company Sanctions Act. This critical legislation prohibits effectively all transactions between Department of Defense designated Chinese surveillance companies and a U.S. entity. The measure strengthens the bipartisan action Congress is already taking to prevent the Chinese Communist Party from accessing American investment to expand their military might. Combatting China and its encroachment on our nation's national security remains one of my top priorities in Congress.

170," The Tax Nightmare before Christmas Dear Friend, Merry Christmas! Today, may you experience the gift of joy, the blessing of hope, and the peace of His love surrounded by friends and family! To prevent a nightmare before Christmas, this week House Republicans and I have been working on delaying the 1099-K tax hike for an additional year which would have left 40 million people with unbearable tax paperwork underneath their tree this morning. Democrats in Congress have played the grinch long enough and refuse to acknowledge that they've stuck Americans with a tax bill that they don't owe. Hence, last Friday I alongside Senator Shelley Moore Capito introduced the Emergency Taxpayer Paperwork and Audit Relief Act. This bill will provide an additional year for a Republican-controlled House of Representatives to fix the Democrat budget gimmick in the American Rescue Plan that lowers the threshold for Americans to receive a 1099-K form from the IRS for an additional year and prevent tens of millions of Americans from being left out in the cold this winter! This Friday, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced a delay in the implementation of the 1099-K reporting requirement for one year. This delay is a great relief for taxpayers, small businesses, payment platforms, online marketplaces, and the Internal Revenue Service, who will all be saved from an avalanche of tax forms that were expected to hit in just a number of days. While the IRS announcement can let us sigh a breath of relief, a permanent fix is still needed. Lastly, this week Democrats dropped the $1.7 Trillion and 4,000-plus page Omnibus in the middle of the night. Although any package of this size is going to have good things in it, and even delivers funding directly into southern West Virginian communities, I was obliged to vote no. The process of giant Omnibus legislation is broken and will be reformed by the Republican-led House of Representatives in the new year. Let us take a moment today to reflect on the true meaning of Christmas, and may God bless you today and every day. As always, do not hesitate to reach out to my office.

This bill will provide an additional year for a Republican-controlled House of Representatives to fix the Democrat budget gimmick in the American Rescue Plan that lowers the threshold for Americans to receive a 1099-K form from the IRS for an additional year and prevent tens of millions of Americans from being left out in the cold this winter! This Friday, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced a delay in the implementation of the 1099-K reporting requirement for one year. This delay is a great relief for taxpayers, small businesses, payment platforms, online marketplaces, and the Internal Revenue Service, who will all be saved from an avalanche of tax forms that were expected to hit in just a number of days. While the IRS announcement can let us sigh a breath of relief, a permanent fix is still needed. Lastly, this week Democrats dropped the $1.7 Trillion and 4,000-plus page Omnibus in the middle of the night. Although any package of this size is going to have good things in it, and even delivers funding directly into southern West Virginian communities, I was obliged to vote no. The process of giant Omnibus legislation is broken and will be reformed by the Republican-led House of Representatives in the new year. Let us take a moment today to reflect on the true meaning of Christmas, and may God bless you today and every day. As always, do not hesitate to reach out to my office. I am here to help you and greatly value your input. Warm regards, Carol D.

It's been a wonderful year with an even better one to come. I'm keeping it brief this week because Christmas is about spending time with your family, not political chats with your local Congressman. But I wanted to share a quick message about the Christmas season and why this one, especially, is so important. Ever since COVID-19, and the passing of both my father and father-in-law, I've found a new appreciation for quality time with friends and family. When I look at my grandbabies, I am excited for all the life they have in front of them and everything that they will accomplish in this world. That is what motivates me to do what I do, because I want to leave behind a better world, a better First Congressional District, for the next generation. To my grandbabies, Christmas is a visit from Santa, but for me, it is a reminder of the greatest gift of all - the birth of Christ, who I see a glimpse of in each of their eyes. As a man of faith, I am humbled by the Christmas story. Let us all remember the true meaning of Christmas, to celebrate the life of the Son of God, who sacrificed his life so that we can experience the beauty of forgiveness. Let us use his words and example to build a future that is merry and bright. Our grandbabies will thank us for it. BUDDY'S BRIEFING In this week's edition of Buddy's Briefing , we're celebrating Christmas - Elf style. from our nation's capitol cccxc Tuesday, December 20, 2022 : I'm on St. Simons Island this morning as I meet with constituents and Glynn County Engineers to discuss permitting issues along the coast as well as traffic issues on the Island. As St. Simons continues to grow, the traffic also grows, and proper planning is essential to maintaining the quality of life on this golden isle. Afterwards, I head to another meeting on the island with members of the board of the Boys and Girls Club of Southeast Georgia as well as the Executive Director, Brian Dolan, to discuss the great work they are doing in the area and concerns they have in the community. The mission of this great organization is to enable all young people, especially those who need it the most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, and responsible citizens. With numerous locations in Glynn and McIntosh Counties, the work this club does is invaluable. Afterwards, I head back to the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport where I fly to Washington for the week. Wednesday, December 21, 2022 : After meeting with staff and catching up on work in my office this morning, I record a video congratulating Chatham Area Transit (CAT) on their 35th anniversary of providing accessible, efficient, and quality services to Chatham Countians. Next, I join in on our all staff conference call before heading to the House Chamber where I pay tribute to my good friend, Jerry Konter from Savannah, who is finishing up his year as President of the National Homebuilders Association. I also pay tribute to the Ware County Gators football team who recently capped an unbeaten season by winning the Georgia High School Class 5A state championship, their first state football championship in school history. Next, I pay tribute to the Benedictine Cadets football team from Savannah who recently won their second straight Georgia High School Class 4A state championship and finish with a tribute to Pierce County's favorite son, Stetson Bennett IV , quarterback of the National Champion Georgia Bulldogs, who recently finished fourth in voting for the Heisman Trophy as college football's best player. Recently, C-Span identified me as having spoken from the Chamber the second most of any member of Congress during this session. With so many worthy individuals and groups from the First District deserving recognition, it's no wonder I speak so often in the Chamber. Once back in my office, I have a virtual call with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to discuss concerns with Housing Authorities in our District. Later, I have a pre-recorded interview with One America News (OAN) to discuss Democratic pressure tactics to suppress free speech in our Country. As a member of the Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee, I serve on the Telecommunications Subcommittee that has jurisdiction over this area and our plans for next session include a closer look at this situation. Next, I head to the Cannon Rotunda where I have an on-camera interview with Gray TV (WTOC-TV Savannah) to discuss Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to the White House today and address to a Joint Meeting of Congress tonight. Afterwards, I have an interview with the Atlanta Journal Constitution (AJC) regarding the same subject. After returning to my office for more work, I head to the House Chamber for the Joint Meeting of Congress where we hear from President Zelenskyy who brings us up to date on the situation in his country and the unprovoked invasion by Russia. This is the second time I have heard Zelenskyy speak as I was in Munich, Germany, earlier this year when he spoke at the Munich Security Conference the week before Russia invaded his country. President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people are heroes to democracy around the world. After the speech, I head back to my office and return to the House Chamber at 8:45 PM for votes that last until 11:30PM. Thursday, December 22, 2022 : While we were originally scheduled to be out this week, we are obviously in, and the reason is because the Continuing Resolution (CR) that keeps the federal government running will expire tomorrow unless we pass another CR or pass the Omnibus bill that is being negotiated between appropriation chairs in the House and Senate. Our hope was that the Senate would work and pass their bill last night and have it to us for consideration this morning. Because that didn't happen, we are now in a ""hurry up and wait"" mode. This morning, I join in on a virtual call with Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy who brings us up to date on the progress of the negotiations but has little news of the schedule. Shortly after lunch we have our first vote series of the day and, after registering my votes, I join in the ""hurry up and wait"" mode for the remainder of the day. Friday, December 23, 2022 : Well, the Senate finally passed their Omnibus bill last night and today we have 3 vote series where the $1.7 Trillion Omnibus bill is finally passed with little Republican help in the House. Now this monstrosity of a bill goes to the President's desk for his signature and, if signed before 12:00 AM tonight, the Federal Government will stay open and continue to operate. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, this is the last action that will be taken by the 117th Congress as we are not due back in until January 3, 2023, when the 118th Congress will convene. votes in the house this week Click here for this week's vote sheet in the House.

Standing Against $1.7 Trillion in Wasteful Spending For the past two years, President Biden and Congressional Democrats used their one-party rule to pass massive spending bills and further their far-left radical agenda - at the expense of American taxpayers. This week was no different, as Democrats pushed a 4,155-page bill with a price tag of $1.7 trillion. Congress has never passed a lame-duck omnibus spending bill before the incoming majority takes power - and we shouldn't start now. Washington, D.C. is broken, but come January, the new House Republican majority will rein in our out-of-control federal government. End of Title 42 Delayed by Supreme Court Last week, Title 42 - which serves as the last line of defense in securing our border - was expected to end on Wednesday. Thankfully, the Supreme Court issued a temporary hold on the expiring order. This ruling prevents an additional 10,000 illegal immigrants per day from crossing our border - which will happen if Title 42 ends. Predictably, the White House had no plan to counteract this potential surge. Here's what we should do: finish the wall, adequately fund our border patrol agents, and enforce our immigration laws. It's that simple. Breaking Down the Issues Reschenthaler: The FBI Peddled Disinformation Reschenthaler: Voters Chose the Republican Agenda. Five Members Are Obstructing It.

I am incredibly honored to have spent the last two years representing you and all of New York's 2nd Congressional District during my first term in Congress. I am proud of all we have accomplished together, from securing funding directly to NY-02 for community projects - including for local sewer projects, small businesses services, flood resilience, and local non-profit organizations - to passing legislation to support our veterans and fighting for healthcare services for 9/11 first responders. My team helped thousands of constituents resolve issues with various federal agencies, including by returning over $6 million in benefits, grants, and from other federal programs owed to residents of NY-02. There is still much more work to do, which is why I am so thrilled to be able to continue my work next year and throughout my second term. Rest assured, I promise to keep fighting to ensure Washington, D.C. works hard for the people of Long Island in the 118th Congress.

193," Friends, Nadine and I are sending our warmest wishes to everyone this holiday season. From Hanukkah to Christmas to Kwanza, this is a time to enjoy family and friends and reflect on all the blessings we've experienced over the past year. The last few weeks, I've been in Washington as we wrap up the final legislative business of this very productive year and prepare for a new Congress to begin in January. One of the highlights of the past few weeks was the passage of the Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act, which Senator Booker, Congresswoman Sherrill, and I successfully championed this Congress alongside of New Jersey U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas and her husband Mark Anderl. Many of you may remember the attack on her home-carried out by a racist individual who targeted her because of her status as a Latina and a judge-that killed her son, Daniel, and injured her husband. Our bill, named in her son's memory, will ensure that federal judges can perform their solemn duty of administering equal justice under the law without fear of retaliation. We also passed the annual National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, that safeguards our national security and supports our service members with the resources they need to defend our country, while also giving them a 4.6% pay raise, a 2% housing allowance increase, and expanded childcare benefits. And to cap off the year, this week we passed the government funding bill that included many of the priorities I've been fighting for throughout this Congress-from securing a five-year extension of the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program and an additional 200 slots for Graduate Medical Education to providing justice and relief to 9/11 families and other American victims of terrorism. I also secured $181 million in funding specifically for key projects and programs across the Garden State. These achievements come on top of all we've already accomplished this year including the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Respect for Marriage Act, the PACT Act and bipartisan gun reform, just to name a few. I'm proud of the work we've done this Congress, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the next Congress to advance the issues that were left behind. Until next time, I hope you and your family are staying safe and healthy this winter. If you're not already, make sure to follow me on Twitter , Instagram , and Facebook to stay up to date on what's happening in New Jersey and the Capitol, and stay tuned for future emails with more opportunities to share your thoughts with me.

194," Jan's Plans & Pans - December 24, 2022 Dear    , On Friday, I voted in favor of the Fiscal Year 2023 government funding legislation . This monumental funding package will have major implications for generations to come. Not only does this omnibus package secure nearly $27 million in funds for Illinois' 9th Congressional District , but it also protects American consumers and makes critical investments in American families and workers. As the Chairwoman of the Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee, I am proud to see that many of the bipartisan bills my subcommittee fought so hard for were included in the year-end package. The INFORM Consumers Act will help curb the onslaught of dangerous, counterfeit, and stolen products available to Americans shopping on online marketplaces. The STURDY Act will keep dangerous furniture products that can injure and kill children off the market and out of our homes. I was also thrilled that the Lymphedema Treatment Act , which I have worked on for many years, was included in this package. It will expand access to medical compression garments and help up to three million Lymphedema patients on Medicare. The package now heads to President Biden's desk, where he will sign it into law. The 117th Congress was one of the most successful Congresses in history. Not only did we kickstart the fastest, strongest jobs recovery in modern times by adding more than 10 million jobs in just two years, but we also rebuilt our roads, bridges, ports and water systems, made the largest investment ever in our climate, and slashed prescription drug costs. We also passed legislation to keep guns out of dangerous hands and legislation that solidifies our right to marry the person we love. These consequential new laws will change countless lives. I truly believe I have the best staff in all the country! This year, the constituent advocates in my Chicago and Glenview offices helped a total of 2,728 constituents navigate issues with various federal agencies, and thanks to their hard work, constituents saved or were refunded over $1.3 million. If you need any assistance, whether it be a Social Security problem, an immigration case, or a postal issue, just to name a few, my office is here to help. Head to my website for further assistance and information. It is the honor of my life to serve Illinois' 9th Congressional District. This year, we delivered life-changing results for millions of Americans. Despite all of our success, there is more work to be done. I am ready to hit the ground running in the 118th Congress! Merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, joyous Kwanzaa, and happy New Year! Sincerely, End of Year Review Free COVID-19 Tests Available Thanks to the Biden administration, you can now get four more free Covid-19 at-home test kits delivered to your door. You can order online via the federally run website . Orders will be mailed by USPS, starting this week. To receive the kits, you only need to provide a U.S. residential address when ordering.

It's been a busy week in Arizona and in Washington, D.C.! If you would like to share this newsletter with others, please direct them to this link and encourage them to subscribe. I hope you all have a wonderful holiday season, Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year! It was great to join so many constituents in Peoria, AZ to discuss how House Republicans will have the majority next Congress and to celebrate the holiday season! I met with Arizona Corporation Commission Chairwoman Lea Márquez Peterson to discuss working together on energy issues, the need to have reliable, affordable energy sources, and how we must secure our nation's energy independence! I had a great time speaking with constituents in Sun City, AZ! I also met with constituents in Sun City Grand, AZ! Lesko Opposes Democrats' Reckless Spending Package House Democrats rammed through a $1.7 trillion, 4,155-page monstrosity, and I was proud to vote no on this terrible bill. Our national debt is now over $31 trillion. Congress cannot keep spending money we simply do not have. We have borrowed so much money that federal interest payments could exceed our entire defense spending as early as 2025. This package is full of egregious provisions to support the priorities of the radical left. This reckless package appropriates $575 million of American taxpayer dollars to fund ""reproductive health,"" code words for abortion, where ""population growth threatens biodiversity."" In short, it funds abortion as a solution to environmental problems. This legislation includes $410 million for the border security of Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia, and Oman, but fails to secure our own southern border. What's more, this bill includes a provision that renames a Federal building in San Francisco, California after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Democrats' reckless spending has been a key driver of the cost-of-living crisis Arizonans and Americans across our nation are facing, yet this package only doubles down on these failed spending policies. I strongly opposed this package that will increase our debt and make life more costly for the American people. Lesko Protects Amateur Radio This week, I introduced the Amateur Radio Communications Improvement Act to eliminate the current Symbol Rate Limit set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and replace it with a 2.8 kilohertz (kHz) bandwidth limit. The bill brings regulations up to speed with modern technology advances in amateur radio. With advances in our modern technology, increased amounts of data can be put on the spectrum, so there is less of a need for a regulatory limit on symbol rates. I was pleased to introduce this important piece of legislation to update the FCC's rules to support the critical role amateur radio operators play and better reflect the capabilities of our modern radio technology. Lesko Announces Congressional App Challenge Winners I am pleased to announce the winners for this year's Congressional App Challenge! Molly Budhiraja, a high school student at BASIS Peoria in Peoria, AZ, won this year's challenge for her app called Project Toy Exchange , a web-based app that allows parents to connect in order to exchange their children's toys or donate them. This helps parents reduce the money spent on toys and brings a smile to a child's face. The second place app was the COVID-19 Tracker , created by Apramey Akkiraju and Rohan Agrawal, students at Mountain Ridge High School in Glendale, AZ. This app creates a color-coded map to show the concentration of COVID-19 cases in the Western U.S. and provides numerical data regarding COVID-19 cases and deaths. The third place app was Math4Life2 , created by Alexandra Acuna and Tori Lugo, students at Challenge Charter School located in Glendale, AZ. This app helps children with multiplication problems and seeks to make math more fun. In the News I want to make sure you don't miss a minute of what I'm doing to fight for Arizonans each and every day. Check out my latest interviews below. The Todd Starnes Show I joined the Todd Starnes Show to discuss why I opposed the Democrats' reckless spending package, how the Biden Administration is complicit in cartels' criminal activities at the southern border, and the sham January 6 th Committee. Network of enlightened Women I also joined the Network of enlightened Women to discuss the work I am doing in Congress and my advice for young conservative women! Watch below: GET THE FACTS: Biden's Border Crisis is a Public Health Crisis President Biden's open border policies have allowed fentanyl and other illicit, deadly drugs to freely flow across our southern border. As 2022 comes to an end, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) announced the seizure of over 50 million fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills and over 10,000 pounds of fentanyl powder this year. That is enough fentanyl to kill every single American. In 2021, more than 100,000 Americans died of a drug overdose or poisoning, with 70,000 dying from fentanyl or its analogs. This is a very pressing crisis. In less than two weeks, House Republicans will hold the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, and we commit to a nation that is safe, including from deadly fentanyl. We will work to pass legislation to permanently give law enforcement the tools they need to keep fentanyl off our streets. Another critical step is securing our border to stop the flow of deadly fentanyl into our communities to save precious lives. Around the District Monica from our office presented a Congressional Recognition to Stephanie Myer, who has gone above and beyond as a leader in our Arizona communities.

198," News from Representative Speier Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window Click here to open a plain text version of this email December 24, 2022 Dear Friends, It was a busy and productive week in Washington, with my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives and I passing the final government funding package for Fiscal Year 2023. This $1.7 trillion-dollar omnibus package includes over $16 million in federal funding for local community projects in my district and $54 million for San Francisco Bay restoration efforts. That's more than double the amount the Bay received last year. The bipartisan funding package will keep our federal agencies running so that the government can continue to serve the people while providing for our national defense. It includes emergency supplemental funding to respond to the devastation wrought by recent natural disasters and extreme weather events and emergency resources to support the Ukrainian people and protect global democracy in the face of Russia's continued invasion of Ukraine. I was deeply moved and inspired by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's joint address to Congress this week. President Zelensky made clear that America's continued resolve and Ukraine's courage means that Ukraine will win the war next year and that the funds and weapons we have provided to Ukraine are not charity, but an investment in global security and freedom. It also includes a long-overdue down payment on our commitment to deliver for women. Enacting the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act, and urgently needed funding to support maternal health care, access to child care, protection from violence, and much more will deliver huge results for women and their families. It's not surprising that the progress made this year happened under the watchful eyes of women in power. However, I was extremely disappointed that congressional Republicans refused to agree to an extension of the expanded Child Tax Credit, which lifted over half of the children in America out of poverty. I urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to continue working toward making the CTC expansion a permanent benefit for the betterment of our hardworking American families and country's future. Though my time in Congress is coming to a close in January, I and my staff continue to work on behalf of my constituents in Washington and here at home. I've had the honor and privilege of meeting with many of you at my recent town halls held in Burlingame, Half Moon Bay, South San Francisco, and Redwood City to deliver my final progress report. I delivered my final speech on the House floor this week, which you can watch by clicking here . And I will be holding a press conference on December 27th to celebrate the over $16 million in federal funding for local community projects that I was able to secure in the omnibus. I may be retiring from Congress, but I am not retiring from fighting the good fight on behalf of everyone here at home. I encourage you to join me in that fight, and in making good trouble, for the benefit of all Americans. One way to do that is to ensure we're well-informed with verified, factual reporting. By doing this, and working together, we can and will overcome all obstacles. Wishing you all a Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and Blessed Kwanzaa, As a Member of Congress, it is my honor and privilege to share information with my constituents in California's 14th District.

Faces of the Investigation Through televised hearings and rare Republicans willing to publicly criticize Donald Trump, the House Jan. 6 committee tried to get accountability for the Capitol attack. By Frank Thorp V and Sarah Mimms, NBC News WASHINGTON - Long after the rioters left the U.S. Capitol, the shattered glass was swept up and the nation began its reckoning with the Jan. 6 attack, the people who were there that day and those most affected by the unprecedented violence are still seeking answers. They include members of Congress who had been chased out of their chambers. The police officers who defended them. And the election officials across the country who continue to face threats over a lie. Now, after hundreds of interviews and television hearings, the House Jan. 6 committee investigating the attack has finished its work and issued its final report. The panel, led by Chair Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., relied heavily on Republican witnesses, members of former President Donald Trump's own party who testified publicly about the lead-up to and the aftermath of the violence. Like the panel's two GOP members, many of them have lost their careers over it; some say they have lost close friends. To read the complete article, click here . Congress isn't extending 4 popular tax breaks in omnibus bill passage The omnibus bill is proving to be a Grinch for companies and families By Julie Zauzmer Weil, The Washington Post Lawmakers seized on the opportunity presented by the massive end-of-year spending bill making its way through Congress to insert some of their favorite changes, including modifying how retirement savings are treated. But on taxes, Congress was poised Thursday to mostly not take action in this omnibus bill, even to extend provisions that American families or companies have been clamoring for. You can read more here about what the $1.7 trillion bill will do. Here is a list of four tax breaks it will not extend. To read the complete article, click here . Afghanistan's Taliban Ban All Education for Girls Afghan girls and women have been squeezed out of public and professional life since the Taliban takeover last year By Esmatullah Kohsar and Sune Engel Rasmussen, The Wall Street Journal The Taliban banned girls from attending elementary school, effectively instituting a total ban on the education of girls and women and dealing one of the most dramatic blows yet to women's freedoms since seizing power last year. In a gathering in Kabul with private-school directors, clerics and community representatives, Taliban officials on Wednesday also barred female staff, including teachers, from working in schools, closing off one of the few professions that had remained open to Afghan women under the new government, according to school principals who attended the meeting. They also said adult women could no longer visit mosques or attend religious seminaries. Ghulam Sarwar Haidari, a shopkeeper in Kabul, said his daughter Mahbooba was sent home when she arrived at the tutoring center where she was attending classes in preparation for the coming semester in fifth grade. Mahbooba had hoped to study medicine and return to their home village in Ghazni province, where there are no female doctors. ""My daughter has locked herself in a room since this morning and won't stop crying,"" Mr. Haidari said. ""All her hopes are broken. We are tired to death of this situation, and only wonder when it will be over."" To read the complete article, click here . The Olive Green Sweatshirt Goes to Congress President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine came to Washington wearing his reality on his sleeves. By Vanessa Friedman, The New York Times He never donned the political camouflage of a suit. The olive green sweatshirt, with its little Ukrainian trident embroidered at the neck, cargo pants and boots that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine wore on his trip to Washington may seem the least important part of the highly choreographed and powerful piece of political theater that was that diplomatic event, but they were also a telling detail: a reminder of what exactly the purpose of the surprise visit had been. Namely, that despite the fact that it was Mr. Zelensky's first foreign trip since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began, and despite the fact that Ukraine has defied all odds in holding out for 10 months against an aggressor that was widely expected to roll over the country with ease, the watching world should be on notice: The fight was far from over. In his wartime uniform, Mr. Zelensky was a constant, living symbol of that battle, no matter the pomp and circumstance that surrounded him. To read the complete article, click here .

199," As we celebrate the holidays with our loved ones, we remember the true reason for the season: the birth of our Lord, Jesus Christ. His teachings remind us to love one another, share our gratitude for all the good things in our lives and give back to those less fortunate. Through these acts, we can experience the real magic of Christmas. My family has a tradition of attending the 4 PM Christmas Eve mass in Pierre. After the service, we gather together at my house and enjoy a homecooked meal of chicken noodle soup. In total, we will host about 100 people, including my four kids and ten grandkids that you see pictured above, as well as some of my siblings and their kids and grandkids. I'm looking forward to celebrating the holiday at my home again this year, and continuing to tell the story of Christmas. It is a chance for all of us to reflect upon what is truly important this holiday season: family, friends, and the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. For some, the holidays can be a challenging time of year. You never know what someone is going through. Showing kindness costs nothing and can make a difference in someone's day, week or even year. During the Christmas season, we are reminded to spread the message of peace on earth and goodwill to all. This is a message that we should remember throughout the rest of the year as well. Of course, none of us would be able to celebrate the holidays freely if not for our men and women in uniform and their families. This time of year, we remember those who are spending the holidays away from home as they fight to protect our freedom. Our service members and their families deserve our eternal gratitude for the sacrifices they make on behalf of our country. From my family to yours, I would like to wish you all a very blessed Christmas and peace in the new year. It is an honor to work for you in the United States Senate.

Merry Christmas Kansans, I always find myself thinking about hope during the Christmas season. In the midst of our busy lives and chaotic world, Christmas is a time to refocus our perspective and reground our hope on Jesus. I pray that the Lord would give each of us little reminders of himself this Christmas season and that we take a moment to thank him for the blessing of living in a country where we can live out our faith freely. As we celebrate Christmas with our loved ones, I am praying specifically for those unable to be with their families today. I'm thinking of the brave men and women serving their communities as law enforcement officers, first responders, medical professionals, and U.S. military service members. Thank you for the sacrifices that you make every day, and especially today. Wishing you a safe and warm Christmas weekend, and a happy New Year. Yours in Service, While Christmas is a time to be with loved ones and celebrate the gift of our Savior, the holiday season can be difficult for many individuals, especially our nation's heroes.

203," Dear Friend, For many of us, the holidays have come at a difficult time. After more than a year of the highest prices in decades, celebration is the last thing on some of our minds. After all, it's difficult to get in the holiday spirit when the focus is paying for gas or groceries. In times when budgets are tight, it is even more important that we express our gratitude for the things that truly matter this holiday season. This year, one thing we are grateful for is the opportunity to honor three dearly missed Minnesotans. This week, the Senate passed our bill to rename the Avon Post Office in honor of Army National Guard Warrant Officer Candidate Kort M. Plantenberg. Kort passed away in 2019 alongside two fellow Guardsmen, Chief Warrant Officer 2 James A. Rogers Jr. and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Charles P. Nord, in 2019 during a routine training operation. With the passage of this legislation to memorialize Kort and similar bills from Representative Michelle Fischbach to honor James and Charles, all three Guardsmen will have permanent recognition of their sacrifice. As a military family, we recognize the many Americans, like Kort, Charles, and James' families, that are spending the holidays without loved ones. This time of year gives us the opportunity to reflect and appreciate all of our service members, while remaining mindful of their family's sacrifice during the holiday season. I am so grateful to be able to spend the holiday season with my wife Jacquie, our children and grandchild. We are blessed to be able to be home in Minnesota - even if it is forecast to be one of the coldest Christmases in years - and appreciate all of the joys that family brings when we're together. There is still a lot to be thankful for and I hope that you all have a very Merry Christmas, filled with peace, light, and love.

207," Dear Friend, As this year comes to a close, I couldn't be more proud of all that we've accomplished to build a brighter future for Marylanders. This year, we passed the largest climate change legislation in our nation's history, legislation to create millions of good-paying jobs in American-made manufacturing, legislation to lower prescription drug and health care costs, and legislation to provide better benefits to veterans, public safety officers, and their families. All of these efforts were signed into law and are now working for the American people. I also presented millions of dollars in Community Project Funding to organizations right here in Maryland's Sixth District, and I'm working to secure millions more. We have a lot to be proud of this year, but we can't forget that there's still more work to be done. As we enter this new year, and new Congress, know that I won't stop fighting for effective, bipartisan solutions to change our communities for the better. As my team and I continue to work on the issues that are important to you, don't forget to follow my official Twitter , Facebook , and Instagram pages to stay in touch and let me know how we can do better. Investing in Local Community Projects Congressman Trone awards $850,000 in Community Project Funding to the Frederick County Crisis Stabilization Center This year, I was proud to secure $7.8 million of federal funding to support projects across our district. By getting on the ground and talking with local leaders, I've worked to help identify needs that can be met with Community Project Funding. In Garrett County, we secured more than $883,000 to expand broadband to more than 270 households, 24 farms, and 17 businesses. In Montgomery County, we secured $1 million for 5G job training to ensure that we successfully build tomorrow's workforce by providing training and good-paying jobs - all while expanding broadband across our state. I'll keep fighting to ensure that everyone has access to high-speed, affordable internet to grow our rural economies, increase telehealth, and improve education outcomes for our children. I came to Congress with the mission of ending our nation's worsening mental health and addiction crises. That's why I'm glad to say we made significant progress right here in our district by awarding $465,518 to Meritus Medical Center for crisis stabilization beds, $325,000 to EveryMind for Crisis Prevention, and $850,000 to create the Frederick County Crisis Stabilization Center. I've also secured Community Project Funding to help us strengthen infrastructure, with nearly $535,000 for the Motter Avenue Area Community Flood Mitigation Project in Frederick and $500,000 for the South Germantown Recreational Park's trails. This is how we make our communities stronger and safer. Supporting First Responders and Their Families Congressman Trone holds a roundtable discussion on first responder mental health First responders face immense stress, pressure, and trauma in their line of work, and Congress must act to provide support for public safety officers. Just over three years ago, our community lost Montgomery County Police Officer Thomas ""T.J."" Bomba to suicide. Following this tragedy, I held a roundtable on mental health care with public safety officers to listen and learn about how Congress can provide support. This year, Congress was able to take a step in the right direction by passing my Public Safety Officer Support Act . The new law extends benefits to officers and their families who suffer from PTSD or die by suicide. First responders make tremendous sacrifices to keep our communities safe, and this is the least we can do to honor their dedication. I also voted to pass crucial investments in our nation's law enforcement, including funding small Maryland police agencies through grants to retain and recruit officers; reducing the use of force and investing in accountability measures, including de-escalation training; improving response to substance use disorder-related calls; and, improving support for survivors of domestic violence. These efforts will build trust between our law enforcement and our citizens and protect lives. That's what matters. Creating Jobs and Investing in American Competitiveness Congressman Trone visits NIST to discuss FY23 funding and tours the Robotics Test Facility I proudly supported the CHIPS and Science Act , which was signed into law by President Biden this summer. This bill will invest over $52 billion in our semiconductor industry to decrease dependence on overseas chips and build domestic manufacturing from the ground up. Our strategic investments will cement the U.S. as a globally-competitive leader and innovator. It also authorizes nearly $170 billion for the largest five-year investment in public STEM research and development in our country's history. This includes $9 billion for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to expand its facilities right here in Maryland's Sixth District. In addition to providing $39 billion of financial incentives for manufacturing plants, the CHIPS and Science Act delivers $11 billion to workforce development programs. It will establish tech innovation hubs in new parts of the country, develop the next generation of STEM leaders, and make it easier to apply research in manufacturing. Those are goals we can all get behind. Lowering Costs for Families and Building a Brighter Tomorrow Congressman Trone speaks to residents at Country Meadows of Frederick about health care provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act It's always been my view that access to high-quality, affordable health care is a fundamental human right. No American should have to decide between seeking medical care and feeding their family. I know times have been tough on many Marylanders, which is why I supported the Inflation Reduction Act . This legislation will ease the burden on families by allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, placing a $2,000 yearly cap on out-of-pocket prescription drug costs, and setting a $35 monthly cap on insulin for those with Medicare. Furthermore, the Inflation Reduction Act makes significant efforts to ease the effects of climate change. The bill will lower energy costs while also reducing carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030 . These investments will not only help to protect our earth for our kids and grandkids, but they will also create nearly 9 million new jobs. These are huge wins, and all of this is paid for by closing tax loopholes and making the ultra-wealthy pay their fair share. There will be no new taxes on small businesses or families making $400,000 or less. I'm excited to see how Marylanders benefit from this historic legislation for years to come. Fighting Gun Violence and Expanding Mental Health Resources in our Schools Congressman Trone held a roundtable discussion with Congresswoman Lucy McBath and gun violence survivors and activists from Maryland With the shockwaves of horrifying mass shootings being felt in communities across our nation, it was beyond time for Congress to take action with bipartisan, common-sense gun safety legislation. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, signed into law this summer by President Biden, implements enhanced background checks, narrows the ""boyfriend loophole"" to protect victims of domestic violence, and invests in community violence intervention. The numbers don't lie: mental health among children has only worsened over recent years, especially during the pandemic. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act addresses this by significantly expanding access to community and school-based mental health care for children and families. We still have a long way to go in making our schools and communities safer, but this legislation serves as an important step in the right direction, and I was proud to give it my support. Securing Benefits for Our Toxic-Exposed Veterans Congressman Trone speaks with veterans at the Brunswick Veterans Day Parade Roughly 3.5 million veterans were exposed to toxic substances while serving our country, causing many to experience horrific health impacts. This August, Congress acted to honor veterans' service by passing the Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act to get them the care and benefits they deserve. This legislation includes my Fairly Assessing Service-related Toxic Exposure Residuals (FASTER) Presumptions Act , which would help streamline access to benefits and require a lower burden of proof for toxic-exposed veterans to receive care. As a member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I'm committed to fighting for those who courageously and selflessly served our nation. Happy Holidays from my Family to Yours! Congressman Trone and his wife, June Trone. Lastly, I'd like to wish you happy holidays from all of the Trone family and Team Trone! I'm honored to be able to serve Maryland's Sixth District, and I won't stop fighting for bipartisan, effective solutions - you can count on it.

211," News from Congressman Brian Mast ABOUT GET HELP NEWS CONTACT WHERE IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY?   - While folks across the country have spent the week wrapping gifts, Democrats in Congress were working to deliver a Christmas present no American had on their wishlist: a $1.7 trillion omnibus package. This week, Democratic leaders dropped a 4,155-page bill and put it up for a vote within three days. If any Member of Congress tells you that they read a bill that's three-and-a-half times the length of War and Peace cover to cover, they're lying. But that's the way Speaker Pelosi and her allies want it, because within those thousands of pages, they buried line items to push a woke agenda overseas and fund pet projects across the country. It also included more funding for Ukraine. While I appreciated hearing from President Zelenskyy this week and am impressed by his resolve to stand up to a bully like Vladmir Putin, I cannot, in good conscience, vote to send tens of billions of your tax dollars to a war without a clear strategy. That is why I voted no on this outrageous spending bill. Watch the latest Week in Review for more, and I hope that you and your family have a wonderful Christmas!

212," The Christmas season is a time where American families reflect on their many blessings and the birth of our Savior, Jesus Christ. On this Christmas Eve, I want to share the words of former President George W. Bush from more than 20 years ago: ""Christmas is a time of wonder and joy, of generosity and peace, that brings family and friends together in celebration and song. We sing old hymns and familiar carols, we show love for others in the giving of gifts, and we observe the hallowed traditions that make the season special. This year in the midst of extraordinary times, our Nation has shown the world that though there is great evil, there is a greater good. Americans have given of themselves, sacrificing to help others and showing the sprit of love and sharing that is so much a part of the Christmas season. According to the Gospel of Luke, two thousand years ago, the savior of mankind came into the world. Christians believe that Jesus' birth was the incarnation of God on earth, opening the door to new hope and eternal life. At Christmastime, Christians celebrate God's love revealed to the world through Christ. And the message of Jesus is one that all Americans can embrace this holiday season -- to love one another,"" said President George W. Bush. This holiday season, I look forward to enjoying time with my wife Tracey, our son Patrick and his wife Brittany and new son Zander, our daughter Sydney, and our son Conner and his wife Tori. It is a privilege to continue to serve Virginia's 5th District as your representative in Congress as we enter the New Year. From my family to yours, Merry Christmas! Honoring Our Veterans We must never forget that it is the sacrifices of our brave servicemembers that permit us to enjoy our unique American freedoms. And while we can never fully repay the men and women in uniform for their unwavering dedication to their fellow man, publicly expressing our gratitude is a step in the right direction. Until last week, former U.S. Army Sergeant Donald Truslow had not been properly recognized or presented with his Presidential Unit Citation, Vietnam Service Ribbon with two Bronze Service Stars, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation with Palm Device, and Republic of Vietnam Civil Actions Honor Medal Unit Citation, First Class awards for his courageous combat service in Vietnam over 50 years ago. I was privileged to be a part of correcting this oversight and honoring such an American hero for his gallantry. Thank you, Sergeant Truslow! Saying NO to the Left's Reckless Spending Spree In their final hours in the majority in a lame duck Congress, Democrats frantically passed an earmark-loaded 4,100-page ""omnibus"" spending bill to implement more of their radical leftist agenda using your hard-earned taxpayer dollars. The omnibus bill drains over $1.7 Trillion from American wallets, with $15 billion funding 7,200 pet projects known as ""earmarks"". Those earmarks include $4 million for ""soy-enabled rural road reconstruction"", $3.6 million for the Michelle Obama Trail, $3.5 million for a Congressional Office of Diversity & Inclusion, $3 million for an LGBTQ+ museum, $3 million for bee-friendly highways, $1.5 million for the COVID-19 American History Project, and a building named after Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In typical Democrat fashion, the Schumer-Pelosi regime waited until the end-of-the-year to drop this massive spending bill, giving us little to NO time to read the budget-busting legislation. Instead of securing our Southern Border, ending unconstitutional vaccine mandates, or restoring the successful Trump energy policies, this reckless package furthers the Radical Left's agenda on the backs of hardworking Americans. No Republican should have voted in favor of this bill that will add $1.9 trillion to the national debt, and surrender House Republicans' budgetary leverage in the New Year. This bill is a bad backroom deal that is a Christmas present to the special interests in Washington. Rather than fighting for the voters who elected them to office, some weak and compromised Republicans chose to help pass this terrible bill filled with Biden-Schumer-Pelosi priorities. I reject this gross misuse of power and taxpayer dollars. Americans deserve better than politicians who promise one thing and deliver another. This week I joined Congressman Chip Roy of Texas and 31 of my House Republican colleagues and pledged to oppose any future bills sent to the House from any Republican Senator who supported the passage of this bill. As we look towards the swearing in of the new Congress on January 3rd, it is clear that we need new strong House leadership to fight on behalf of the American people. In the News During my weekly interview with John Fredericks, we addressed Minority Leader McCarthy's efforts to secure the votes to become House Speaker and the disastrous Democrat omnibus spending bill. We need to make a clean break from the status quo in Washington and choose a leader who will fight for the people. Congress is in dire need of change and new leadership.

As we celebrate with family and friends this holiday season, may we take time to reflect on the season's true meaning and the many blessings we have in our lives. As we gather with our families this Christmas, let us also remember those who cannot. From the brave frontline workers and first responders to the courageous men and women of the Armed Forces serving at home and abroad, thank you! From my family to yours, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! I opposed Democrats' reckless spending bill Just yesterday, the government funding bill for Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) passed the House by a vote of 225-201. I strongly opposed the bill for many reasons, including several of the bill's wasteful spending provisions and anti-Second Amendment measures. The funding package also failed to address inflation, fix the crisis at our border, or expand American energy production. After the reckless allocation of trillions in supplementary spending this term by House and Senate Democrats, they capped off their fiscal recklessness with this $1.7 trillion monstrosity of a funding bill. This bill fails to address America's energy crisis or expand funding to proactively secure the border. Further, it does not include backpay for our military men and women who were unjustly placed on leave or dismissed due to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. I could not, in good faith, support this legislation, which at more than 4,000 pages, completely fails to provide the relief that the American people are demanding. Among the only encouraging aspects of this legislation is that it included several requests I advocated for through the Community Project Funding initiative, each of which was subjected to a rigorous review process to ensure it was fiscally responsible and necessary. Importantly, these projects are spending-neutral and simply ensure federal spending reflects the priorities of our communities. You can read my full statement, including more about the Community Project Funding initiative, by clicking here . When I served in the New York State Assembly, we referred to runaway spending bills like the one the House considered yesterday as the ""Big Ugly."" I joined Mornings with Maria this week to share my concerns with the omnibus spending bill, which may just be the biggest ugly I've ever witnessed. You can watch the full video of my interview here or by clicking the link below. House Democrats' partisan decision to release President Trump's tax returns sets a dangerous precedent The partisan decision by Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee to release the private tax returns of former President Donald J. Trump is absolutely unprecedented. It shows just how far the Left will go to weaponize the bureaucracy against the American people. Releasing the tax returns of a private citizen in this manner sets a dangerous new precedent, and House Democrats are proving to the American people exactly why we should resist their partisan efforts to enlarge and empower the IRS. One of the greatest threats to our freedom and our nation's prosperity is an overly powerful bureaucracy that can target and destroy a taxpayer's reputation and livelihood on a whim, without any accountability or oversight. This extreme move by congressional Democrats should alarm every American citizen. It is a direct attack on your privacy, overturning long-held precedents and setting the stage for many more Americans to have their tax information and personal records exposed for purely political reasons. I recently introduced the DIRECT Funds for Border Security Act to stop Joe Biden's plan to use the IRS to target and extort working families. The bill redirects funding for Biden's new army of IRS agents to the border so we can invest in law enforcement and restore operational control. Introduced the bipartisan REGIME Act to hold Iran accountable The Iranian regime continues to deny its people dignity and fundamental human rights. The same regime thugs who are complicit in the abuse, detention or killing of peaceful protesters are also the ones sending their own children and family members to study, live, and thrive here in the United States. The bipartisan REGIME Act will ensure that U.S. visas issued to members of the Iranian regime and their families are immediately revoked so that these individuals cannot seek residency and reap the benefits bestowed by the taxpayers of this country while continuing to deny those same opportunities to so many in their own country. I was honored to stand with my colleagues and co-sponsor this important legislation. Click here to read more about this bill . I'm committed to restoring transparency to government, which is why I explain every vote I take on the House floor. While we may not always agree, you will always know where I stand on the issues and how I vote in Congress. This Congress my office has already explained more than 400 votes. Some of the key bills we considered this week are explained below. To read more about these votes and see the full list with explanations of all the legislation considered this week by the House of Representatives, please click here . I voted ""Yes"" on the Senate Amendment to H.R. 7939, the Student Veteran Emergency Relief Act. This bill would authorize the VA to pay additional education and training benefits to veterans negatively impacted by emergency situations. The bill also expands eligibility for Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits to those veterans who receive sole survivorship discharges. Professional licenses would also be made portable for military spouses so they can continue working while they are stationed with their spouse. This important legislation extends GI Bill flexibilities that were established by Congress for COVID-19 to all emergencies, ensuring our heroes can continue to have access to their benefits. This bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 380-35. I voted ""No"" on H.R. 2617, the bloated and inflation fueling omnibus government funding bill for Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23). I opposed the bill for many reasons, including several of the bill's wasteful spending provisions and anti-Second Amendment measures. The bill also failed to address inflation, fix the crisis at our border, or expand American energy exploration. Among the many faults of the bill it hires only 300 Border Patrol agents and reduces the capacity of ICE detention centers, spends $2.4 billion to house illegal immigrants without appropriating any money to building the border wall, and it spends millions to encourage states to enact unconstitutional ""red flag"" laws. It is time to bring fiscal sanity back to congress so we can finally bring wage-killing inflation under control. This bill passed the House by a vote of 225-201 with 1 member voting present. Continuing my fight for the Delphi salaried retirees across upstate New York In 2009, more than 20,000 Delphi Salaried Retirees, 2,337 of whom reside in New York, lost the full value of their retirement benefits in the aftermath of the General Motors bailout. Following the bankruptcy filing, the company surrendered its pension obligations to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as part of its 2009 bankruptcy agreement. The Obama Administration then worked behind closed doors with union leaders to slash the pensions promised to the 20,000 non-unionized salaried staff. The Susan Muffley Act was introduced in Congress to correct the egregious wrongs and injustices imposed upon the Delphi Salaried Retirees under the Obama Administration by fully restoring their pension plans, with back pay. I was honored to introduce a bipartisan amendment to add the Susan Muffley Act of 2022 to the FY23 omnibus after House and Senate leaders failed to add it. The Delphi Salaried Retirees have been fighting for thirteen years to correct this grave injustice, and it would be a travesty if they had to start from square one next year. Since the Susan Muffley Act passed in the House, I have been working tirelessly to ensure it is signed into law. Unfortunately, the amendment was not adopted, but rest assured that I will continue to fight until the Delphi Salaried Retirees have their full pensions restored. Have news or updates to share?

215," Merry Christmas! From my family to yours, I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! I pray that as you gather with family and friends to celebrate the birth of Christ, you can reflect on the past year and look ahead to all the things to come in the new year. I am optimistic and hopeful about the future and am honored to continue to represent the First District of Arkansas . This week, the Supreme Court put a last-minute hold on the end of Title 42, a Trump-era policy to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by allowing illegal immigrants to be immediately expelled in order to protect American citizens. The Biden Administration acknowledged to the Supreme Court that the end of Title 42 will likely lead to disruption and a temporary increase in unlawful border crossings but still asked the court to reject efforts by 19 states to keep Title 42 in place. Border Patrol officials warned they could face as many as 14,000 illegal migrant encounters a day once it ends which is double the current average. I joined several of my colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden asking him to share a comprehensive plan that outlines how the Administration will maintain control of the Southern Border if Title 42 ends. I look forward to hearing his response. Senate Amendment to H.R. 2617 - FY 2023 Omnibus Appropriations - NO Contains no real​ solutions for the concerns Americans face today like high energy costs, an illegal immigration crisis at the border, and record inflation. Extends many programs for multiple years and provides large funding increases for Democrat priorities on top of the exorbitant spending that has already been appropriated this year. Underfunds Border Patrol Agent hiring despite historic levels of encounters on the border, while spending hundreds of millions of dollars to increase pay for Transportation Security Officers. Subsidizes illegal immigration by providing $10 million for legal assistance for detained migrants. This week, I attended the I-69 groundbreaking in McGehee to commemorate the future interstate. Rep.

216," At the start of the 117th Congress, with a 50-50 Senate and a slim Democratic majority in the House, ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ December 24, 2022 Dear Fellow Marylanders, At the start of the 117 th Congress, with a 50-50 Senate and a slim Democratic majority in the House, many predicted that gridlock would remain the norm on Capitol Hill. As we near the end of the 117 th Congress, I am pleased to report that not only did we overcome gridlock; we achieved tremendously important things for this country. Some of these successes came from Democrats strategically using our majority to advance key initiatives when Republicans would not join us on the path to progress . But far more resulted from our diligent efforts to build bipartisan consensus behind legislation that addressed shared national priorities. The result has been a Congress that achieved remarkable, impactful, and even historic wins on behalf of the American people. The investments made by Congress over the last two years are investments in our communities and the American people. Overall, we have navigated this nation through the unprecedented repercussions of a global pandemic, we brought our economy back from record job losses, supported our small businesses, mitigated supply chain disruptions that had jolted nearly every sector, and supercharged global investments in American manufacturing. We also reduced the number of children in poverty, increased access to life-saving prescriptions and care, and put our nation back on a path towards cleaner air and water. All of this was done while being fiscally responsible and reducing our national deficit at a historic rate. There is more work to be done, but Maryland and the nation are emerging from these two years in much stronger and more stable positions than we started. As 2022 ends, I wanted to share with you a sampling of what I have been able to help achieve as your representative in the United States Senate: Emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic are when government can best bring together the resources that will make a positive difference in people's lives. Among its many provisions, the American Rescue Plan Act provided $1,400 per person in economic relief payments to millions of low- and moderate-income households. It extended a lifeline for those whom the pandemic left jobless, without health insurance, food insecure, behind on utility bills, rent and mortgage payments, and struggling to make ends meet. This package provided timely resources to state and local governments and our courageous front-line workers who worked around-the-clock and often placed themselves at great personal risk to keep our communities safe over the last year. For our families and students, we delivered the resources needed for adequate childcare and we tackle the infrastructure repairs and upgrades needed to reopen schools safely and supplement online learning programs. The increase to the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $3,000 and the expansion of eligibility lifted families out of poverty and gave them a fighting chance to recover from the pandemic. When Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, the fear of women and LGBTQ individuals was palpable. Based on the writings of Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas , the threat to marriage equality was very real. I am proud that Maryland had state-level protections in place to preserve the sanctity of same-sex marriage, but Congress had to ensure that such fundamental rights are respected at the national level. In December 2022, Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law the Respect for Marriage Act , which protects same-sex and interracial marriages nationwide. It took more than 150 years, but in 2021, Congress finally recognized Juneteenth , a day marking the end of slavery in the U.S., as a federal holiday. And this December, thanks to legislation I wrote with Congressman Steny Hoyer, Congress officially approved removing from the Capitol the bust of former Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney, author of the horrific Dred Scott decision. In its place, we will honor a different Marylander, Justice Thurgood Marshall , the first Black American to sit on the Supreme Court. Both hailed from Maryland, but Marshall was a beacon of hope for racial equality. His uplifting voice of equality and opportunity is exactly what our nation needs at this moment. As Chair of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, one of my highest priorities is to ensure that our nation taps into the entrepreneurial spirit that is sweeping our nation to build a fairer and more just economy for all. I fought to reauthorize the Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer programs . These programs represent the best of government-industry partnerships-harnessing the creativity and ingenuity of American entrepreneurs to solve our nation's most pressing public health and national security challenges. The reauthorization is a victory for the State of Maryland, which ranks at the number one state in the nation in research and development spending due to the presence of federal government and academic research institutions. I was proud to help create the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF), which also was part of the American Rescue Plan enacted in March 2021. The program helped more than 100,000 eligible entities with grants equal to their pandemic-related revenue loss up to $10 million and no more than $5 million per location. While there are still many struggling restaurants, who I will continue to fight for, the RRF played a vital role keeping thousands of community restaurants afloat during an unprecedented crisis. I also helped create a fund for Shuttered Venue Grant Operators - museums, theater and concert venues and the like - who saw their business drop overnight during the pandemic. The program provided support for job retention to more than 10,000 venues nationwide, including more than 120 in Maryland like the Children's Theater of Annapolis, Baltimore Chamber Orchestra, Plumpton Park Zoological Gardens, Tri-State Community Concert Association, and others. There are so many positive components to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act but codifying the Minority Business Development Agency and elevating the agency to have an Under Secretary, as well as increased authorized appropriations - up to $110M - is among the investments that will pay dividends long into the future. In Maryland, we also increased the number of Women's Business Centers from one to four, strengthening our ability to provide services for entrepreneurs, students and potential federal contractors. We also have our first Veterans Business Outreach Center , which is based at the University of Maryland, College Park. This is ""one-stop shop for transitioning or active duty service members, veterans, National Guard or reserves, and military spouses."" And I was honored to partner on the inaugural TEDCO Tech Fair , which brought together over 500 underserved small businesses with nine technology companies to share resources and know-how. For decades, one of my passions has been working to find reasonable ways to encourage more Americans to save more for their future. This week, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (FY23 Omnibus), Congress approved a package of retirement and savings reforms called SECURE 2.0 . Nearly half of the reforms in this section were identical to or based on legislation I have been working on with Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio). We make significant improvements to help Americans save more for retirement, encourage small businesses to offer retirement plans, expand access for low-income Americans and provide more certainty and flexibility during retirement years. Every person should have the opportunity for a dignified and secure retirement. Health care and prescription costs are too high in this country, and I have been working with my colleagues to help lower out-of-pocket costs for Americans, families and, especially, our seniors and most vulnerable individuals. The Inflation Reduction Act took a major step forward in this regard by extending the premium subsidies that began with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and were enhanced in the American Rescue Plan Act . This one provision will save median income Maryland families about $2,200 annually. Further, the law caps insulin prices for Medicare beneficiaries at $35 beginning January 2023. Insulin is not a choice but a necessity for so many Marylanders, and seniors will now have peace of mind and predictability of the cost. Rolling out over the next few years, the more than 1 million Maryland Medicare beneficiaries also will see lower prices as the Department of Health and Human Services uses its new authority to negotiate lower drug prices . Estimated to save about $100 billion, we fought to ensure that Medicare patients get the best deal possible on high-priced drugs. The law also will cap out-of-pocket costs for thousands of Maryland seniors at $2,000 a year for Part D prescriptions beginning in January 2025. Prescription drug shortages are a persistent problem, leading to diminished access to vital medications and potentially worse outcomes for patients. Shortages of essential drugs may be worsened because short expiration dates require the discarding of drugs that exceed a labeled shelf life. My legislation, which was included in the FY23 Omnibus, would require the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue or revise guidance to ensure drug manufactures can update their product's shelf life to the longest scientifically supported expiration date. Safe and effective drugs should not be thrown out unnecessarily, causing or exacerbating drug shortages. Telehealth services have been essential tools, and a lifeline for many, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. I was proud to have authored many provisions to make this widely available. Telehealth has bridged the gap for Marylanders and other individuals facing barriers to care and it has helped address health disparities. After working to ensure telehealth services included in early pandemic relief legislation, I am now working with my colleagues to permanently extend Medicare telehealth services nationwide and further improve access to care wherever a patient needs it. The FY23 Omnibus extends our telehealth provisions until the end of 2024, giving time to further demonstrate the incredibly value of these services. Gun violence has been a longstanding crisis in this country. For decades, we've remained at an impasse, unable to move forward any substantial legislation to protect citizens. In response to the horrific shooting in May 2022 that took the lives of 19 elementary school students and two adults in Uvalde, Tex., Congress passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that will help states ensure deadly weapons are kept out of the hands of individuals a court has determined to be a significant danger to themselves or others. It also strengthened background checks for people under 21 who try to buy a gun and provided significant investments to mental health programs and crisis centers. Fentanyl has left a mark on communities across Maryland and nationwide. Two-thirds of the opioid-related deaths in Maryland in 2021 were connected to fentanyl. In an effort to target the countries providing the source chemicals needed to produce this deadly drug, I worked with colleagues on legislation that labels countries like China that are significant sources of these "" precursor chemicals "" as major illicit producing countries. This designation will increase the U.S. capacity to track illicit drugs like fentanyl, saving lives as we aim to stem international distribution of these illegal narcotics and provide resources to support individuals with substance use disorders recover. At home and overseas, the work we do in Congress to defend human and civil rights and strengthen democratic institutions is an investment in our national security and freedom globally. Included in the NDAA is the first comprehensive State Department reauthorization in 16 years. As Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee with oversight for State Department operations, I played a key role in drafting provisions that will modernize and prioritize the training and professional development of our diplomats and civilian foreign policy workforce. I also authored a provision that establishes new requirements for post-employment restrictions for certain Senate-confirmed officials because U.S. foreign policy is not for sale and no one should anyone have reason to think it is. The first days of this Congress were defined by the violent, illegitimate events of Jan. 6. Instead of giving into fear and losing focus, we channeled our energy into sealing any perceived ""crack"" in our legal system that emboldened the bad actors. As a member of a bipartisan working group , I was deeply involved in developing legislation that modernized the Electoral Count Reform of 1887 Act. Approved this week as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act for FY23, we made it easier for Congress to identify a single, conclusive slate of presidential electors for each state, reduced the likelihood of frivolous objections against electors and reiterated the purely ceremonial role the vice president has in this process. A free media is one of the pillars of American democracy, although journalists have been under attack recently both figuratively and literally across America and around the world. Too many, including five innocent souls lost in the shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis in 2018, gave everything they had in defense of democracy, transparency and freedom. For this reason, I was honored to lead the Senate effort to create a National Memorial for Fallen Journalists . The new, privately funded memorial will be constructed on federal lands near the National Mall, across from the Voice of America. It will honor the lives of those who died reporting the news and supporting the media on behalf of the American people. Congress approved the final location in the FY23 Omnibus passed this week. Russia's actions in Ukraine have constituted crimes against humanity and can only be described as genocide . In December 2022, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved my resolution calling Vladimir Putin's unprovoked war exactly that. Congress also has provided emergency funding to support the Ukrainian people and their fight in defense of democracy and sovereignty and we expedited our nation's approval of Finland and Sweden to join NATO. I was honored to escort Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky onto the House floor this week for his address to a joint session of Congress - his only travel outside of Ukraine since Russian began bombarding his country nearly one year ago. As part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), legislation I authored called the Haiti Development, Accountability, and Institutional Transparency Initiative ( HAITI ) Act will help identify persons involved in human rights violations and significant acts of corruption in Haiti and hold them accountable for their actions. Also in NDAA, I helped write legislation that supports democracy activists in Burma and provides resources to aid those investigating crimes against humanity and other humanitarian efforts. I've worked with my colleagues on passage of other legislation to assess the state of human rights in Iran and increase sanctions against corrupt leaders in Nicaragua. In support of the strongest democracy in the Middle East region, the Congress approved my legislation, the Israel Normalization Act , as part of the FY22 funding agreement. The bill builds upon the success of the Abraham Accords, the peace and normalization agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. It encourages other nations to normalize relations with Israel and provides guidance to ensure that existing agreements produce tangible security and economic benefits. Ten years ago, working with my partner Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), I authored legislation that would change the way individuals who commit human rights abuses or engage in significant corruption can be held accountable when their home country willfully turns a blind eye. Our original Russia-specific legislation grew into the Global Magnitsky Human Rights and Accountability Act , and it has been used to sanction dozens of bad actors around the world by blocking their entry into the U.S. and seizing property. This year, in the same legislation that suspended ""normal"" trade relations with Russia and Belarus for the unlawful war in Ukraine, the Global Magnitsky Law was made permanent just months before it was to expire. In April 2021, I was part of a movement that lobbied for President Biden to increase its formal target for refugee admissions after allotments were slashed by the previous administration. This action was critically needed after our military withdrew from Afghanistan, creating a sharp increase of Afghans seeking asylum. With the aid of my colleagues, this policy was revised, allowing for 62,500 refugees in FY 2021 and 125,000 in FY 2022. Additionally, we worked with President Biden to use the "" temporarily protected status "" liberally, allowing for around 143,800 immigrants from 17 countries, including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and Ukraine to seek asylum here. This allows them the opportunity to apply for time-limited permission to live and work in the United States while avoiding potential deportation. Let me be clear that Congress must finally come together to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Our immigration and border security system is broken . We cannot continue to tinker and patch. We must ensure that our borders are secure, while at the same time honoring America's long-time commitment to providing refuge to those seeking asylum as they flee and persecution in their home countries. Compassion is an American value that should be an essential part of immigration reform in this country. All citizens deserve respect and dignity, but it's paramount that we protect vulnerable populations and their families from violence, crimes, and mistreatment. This Congress saw a wide range of legislation that will make this country safer, while also sending a message that hatred and intimidation will not be tolerated. In March 2022, lynching became a federal hate crime for the first time in this country's history. It is named the Emmett Till Anti-lynching Act , after a 14-year-old who was murdered in 1955 by a racist lynch mob in Mississippi. This law provides another tool for the criminal justice system to hand out appropriate punishments for a heinous crime. The Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) and Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) were monumental to strengthen protections for people who have experienced trauma and domestic violence. The Victims of Crime Act provides victims and their families with financial and legal assistance. We were able to prevent any cuts to the program in Maryland. Reauthorization of VAWA creates and supports comprehensive, cost-effective responses to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking. Fair prosecutors and judges who represent and understand their communities are vital to the criminal justice process. During this Congress, President Biden took my recommendation to appoint the first African American U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland in our nation's history, who was unanimously confirmed by the Senate. We saw this pattern of historic diversity throughout Congress as we confirmed three women to the federal bench in Maryland, making it half women - the first time in Maryland's history. This includes the first Black woman to preside over the court. As a senator, one of the most important responsibilities I have under the Constitution is whether to provide my consent to a president's nomination to the Supreme Court. This April, I cast my vote to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court because she is one of the most qualified individuals ever nominated to this lifetime position. She has sterling legal credentials, immense integrity and is the first public defender and first Black woman to sit on the Supreme Court. Justice Jackson already is making a difference as she works to preserve and protect the Constitution, and ensure that all Americans are treated equally under the law. Unfortunately, in 2021-2022 antisemitic and Asian hate crimes were on the rise. Speaking up and calling out hatred is a start, but we needed a solid ""all-of-society"" approach to combat the issues. In November 2022, in my capacity as chair of the U.S. Helsinki Commission and Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intolerance for the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, I convened a high-level working group with representatives from the White House, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security and civil society to address antisemitism. Our efforts were followed up by President Biden's creation of White House task force to develop a national strategy to end antisemitism. Over the last two years and longer, I have worked closely with my congressional colleagues to increase funding for programs that counter antisemitism and hate, as well as support Holocaust education and Holocaust survivors. We also have expanded assistance to houses of worship amid the rise in threats against religious communities. My work as a member of the U.S. Holocaust Museum Memorial Council has provided an additional opportunity for me to address the increased need for education about the Holocaust and antisemitism in this country and worldwide. Due to misinformation and flagrantly racist language by the former president about the origins of COVID-19, hate-based incidents against Asian Americans in the U.S. spiked during 2022-2021. In May 2021, President Biden signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which makes reporting hate crimes more accessible by boosting public outreach at the state and local level and ensuring that reporting resources are available online in multiple languages. With pride, I can tell you that there is much more to this list, and I will have more to share next week about wins for the Chesapeake Bay and infrastructure across Maryland. You also can find more on my website at . Throughout my years serving on Capitol Hill, I cannot recall another as consequential as the 117th Congress. We have managed to do more for Maryland and this country than most thought thinkable, much less doable.

217," Congressman Smith's E-news: December 24, 2022 Carrying Forward the Happiness of the Christmas Spirit ﻿ As I reflect on the last year and anticipate enjoying time with loved ones during the holidays, I'm filled with both gratitude and resolve. As Americans, we have been granted an unrivaled heritage of freedom and prosperity which we now must secure for future generations. I am deeply thankful for my family, the strong community with which we are blessed in Nebraska, and the country we call home. Despite the challenges we face, and the differences in our perspectives, the United States remains a beacon and destination for those longing for liberty and opportunity the world over. As is my tradition, I've shared here one of President Reagan's Christmas addresses. The following excerpt is from a speech he gave upon lighting the national Christmas tree in 1985. As they so often do, his words ring true today, capturing well the joy and goodwill of the holiday season. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all Nebraskans. President Ronald Reagan Remarks on Lighting the National Christmas Tree (excerpt) December 12, 1985 My fellow Americans, thank you for joining Nancy and me on this festive evening. The menorah stands lighted in Lafayette Park, for this is also the time of Hanukkah, and this season is rich in the meaning of our Judeo-Christian tradition. In a moment we'll be lighting the National Christmas Tree, carrying forward what is now a 62-year tradition first begun by Calvin Coolidge. Tonight, we're drawn in warmth to one another as we reflect upon the deeply holy meaning of the miracle we shall soon celebrate…When we speak of Jesus and of His life, we speak of a man revered as a prophet and teacher by people of all religions, and Christians speak of someone greater-a man who was and is divine. He brought forth a power that is infinite and a promise that is eternal, a power greater than all mankind's military might, for His power is Godly love, love that can lift our hearts and soothe our sorrows and heal our wounds and drive away our fears. He promised there will never be a long night that does not end. He promised to deliver us from dark torment and tragedy into the warming sunlight of human happiness, and beyond that, into paradise. He's never been a halfway giver; His generosity is pure and perfect and sure. This, then, expresses the true meaning of Christmas. If each of us could give but a fraction to one another of what He gave to the whole human family, how many hearts could heal, how much sorrow and pain could be driven away? There's still time for joy and gladness to touch a sad and lonely soul, still time to feed a hungry child, to wrap a present for a kind old man feeling forlorn and afraid, and to reach out to an abandoned mother raising children on her own. There's still time to remember our Armed Forces, to express our profound gratitude to those keeping watch on faraway frontiers of freedom, and to redouble our energies to account for our MIA's. They are not and never will be forgotten… Let us reach out tonight to every person who is persecuted; let us embrace and comfort, support and love them. Let us come together as one family under the fatherhood of God, binding ourselves in a communion of hearts, for tonight and tomorrow and for all time. May we give thanks for an America abundantly blessed, for a nation united, free, and at peace. May we carry forward the happiness of the Christmas spirit as the guiding star of our endeavors 365 days a year. And as we light this magnificent tree, may all the youthful hope and joy of America light up the heavens and make the angels sing. Merry Christmas, and God bless you all. And now we're going to light the tree… Sincerely, Adrian Smith Member of Congress Rep.

219," Meet Richard | How Can I Help You? | Issues | Media Center | Conta ct me Friends, For my family and many of yours, the Christmas season is the best time of the year. It is a time of celebration where we come together with loved ones to share gifts and give thanks for all that is good in our lives - most important to me is the birth of our savior, Jesus Christ. Christmas Day marks the birth of Jesus and the fulfillment of God's promise to all mankind. As it is written in Isaiah 7:14, "" Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call His name Immanuel."" The birth of Christ stands as the beginning of the final stage of God's saving plan for humanity. Born in a manger into the humblest of conditions, the Son of God would come to spread the good news of hope and charity to the people of the world, before suffering death and rising again to grant us salvation. This is a love story that stands alone and instills a renewed sense of hope to all who believe in Him. It was and remains the greatest story ever told. My faith is deeply important to me. It gives me the strength to do my job and live each day with purpose and conviction. While there is much in the world that can get us down, I am grateful for the hope that comes from my faith. I am also deeply grateful to live in a country where all people are free to practice their faith, no matter what it might be. As we celebrate this holiday season, let us remember all those who have defended that freedom serving in our nation's uniform - especially those separated from their own families. Their families bear a heavy burden and deserve our thanks and respect as well. Let us also be thankful to the first responders and health care workers serving on the frontlines to protect the health and wellbeing of our nation. I hope you will join me and Renee in keeping them and their families in our prayers. While this past year has certainly been challenging, there is still so much for which to be grateful. And as one year ends and another begins, I am confident that we, as a nation, will be able to come together and build a better future for all Americans. From the bottom of our hearts, Renee and I would like to wish each of you who celebrate a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I am excited to get back to work and to start confronting the many challenges still facing you and your family. Until then, I hope you enjoy time with family and remember what's most important - our faith, our families, our friends, and the many blessings we enjoy as citizens of the greatest nation on Earth.

222," Hello, Friends - While 2022 has been consumed with Bidenflation and continued unwarranted Congressional spending, I assure you that the 118th Congress ahead will take the first steps in putting us back on track. I will continue standing for Freedom, prosperity, the American Flag, and the spectacular constituents of Florida's First District! MERRY CHRISTMAS! I hope you all have connected with friends, family, and loved ones this holiday season. From my family to yours, have a very Merry Christmas! REP. GAETZ JOINS TUCKER ON FOX NEWS Click Here to Watch! Yesterday, I joined Tucker Carlson on Fox News to discuss Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy's brief visit to the U.S. Capitol. Congresswoman Lauren Boebert (CO) and I have been ridiculed for not standing and clapping as this foreign leader asked for more money from the United States. Taxpayers are set to fund over $100 billion for Ukraine's government and war in a 10-month period. As this war drags on with no end in sight, Democrats finally have a flag they are all willing to stand for - the Ukrainian flag. CONGRESS PASSES $1.7 TRILLION SPENDING BILL The $1.7 trillion Omnibus spending legislation allows Nancy Pelosi to rule America's budget for the next year with a dead hand - in one of the worse deals imaginable. It prioritizes funding for Ukraine's border patrol while tying the hands of our own border patrol. Foreign countries get economic development while Americans get more government-fueled inflation salted with racial equity mandates. The Fauci-stained NIH subdivision of DEI will receive $525 million to push anti-white narratives. The very weaponization of our government against We the People is not only embraced but bathed in cash. Ukraine will be armed with upwards of $50 billion while this bill funds $1.7 billion for the ATF's efforts to disarm and criminalize law-abiding gun owners here at home. This Omnibus Bill is a godsend to globalists abroad and a disaster for the rest of us at home. I am firmly voting NO, and any Congressman that claims to represent the best interests of the American people should too. FIREBRAND LIVE: OMNI-BUST (FEAT. REP. DAN BISHOP) Click Here to Watch!

224," LAST 2 WEEKS IN REVIEW DECEMBER 12 - DECEMBER 23 I'm your representative in Congress and I write to keep you informed. First, I'd like to wish you a happy holiday season! On the Hill Federal Spending: Earlier today, I joined my colleagues in voting to pass the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2023. This piece of legislation includes critical funding for health care, clean energy & climate action, and Ukraine. I also secured more than $38 million in funding for our district as part of the bill. These investments will help cities & towns in the Fourth provide clean drinking water, improve transportation, and stimulate economic development. I worked closely with state and local officials to prioritize these projects and align federal, state, and local funding sources for them. This final bill of the 117th Congress also included a measure - the Electoral Count Act Reform - to harden one institutional weak spot that Donald Trump tried to exploit in his insurrection on January 6th. This bipartisan law to safeguard the peaceful transfer of power, recommended by constitutional experts and the January 6th Committee, is a fitting way to conclude a term that began with an assault on democracy. Ukraine: I was moved by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's words when he spoke at the joint session of Congress earlier this week. He made clear that in 2023, with Ukrainian courage and American resolve, we can defend the principles of the free world against Russia's unprovoked and unjust invasion. Speaking to us from the frontlines of freedom, President Zelenskyy thanked us for our support over the last ten months - and rightfully asked us for more. I am proud that the federal budget for FY23 included additional assistance for Ukraine. This funding will support Ukraine's military with training, weapons, and logistics; replenish US stocks of equipment sent to Ukraine; and provide economic support to the Ukrainian government. Additionally, I've worked across the aisle to build support for the Russian oil price-cap and will continue to work on bipartisan backing for Ukraine. Our support for Ukraine is sending a message to Moscow, it's sending a message to Beijing, and it's sending a message to other authoritarian regimes: the United States is committed to defending the principles of democracy and freedom across the globe. Make your voice heard → Do you think Congress should continue providing support to Ukraine to defend against Russia's invasion? Do you support continuing to provide assistance to Ukraine? Around the Fourth Ørsted Offshore Wind: Earlier this week, I visited Ørsted's Boston office and had a detailed conversation about the technology, politics, and economics of offshore wind. In order to hit President Biden's goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030 - and to make sure that Massachusetts is the hub of this growing industry - we need strong public-private collaboration. Offshore wind will continue to be a top priority for me. From supporting construction and installation to growing our mariner workforce, there is plenty that the U.S. needs that Massachusetts can provide. I'll remain a champion of offshore wind in the 118th Congress because I want cheap, clean energy for Bay Staters and good jobs in southeastern Massachusetts. Congressional App Challenge: Congratulations to Alyssa Feinberg, Julia Hulburd, Salome Hizanishvili, and Sophie Strausberg for winning our district's Congressional App Challenge by developing CommunAphasia. Each year, middle and high school students from across the district are encouraged to learn to code and develop an app to be submitted for consideration. CommunAphasia took a unique approach to improve the quality of life of people with Aphasia - a language impairment that hinders a person's ability to communicate. The application provides a messaging system that uses icons and symbols to make it easier for people with Aphasia to communicate.

225," I just voted no on the Democrats' $1.7 Trillion, 4,000+ page spending bill that will make inflation worse while doing nothing to address the border and drug crisis plaguing our country. December 23, 2022 I just voted no on the Democrats' $1.7 Trillion, 4,000+ page spending bill that will make inflation worse while doing nothing to address the border and drug crisis plaguing our country. Democrats have once again proven themselves incapable of crafting a responsible fiscal agenda that meets the needs of hardworking families. Despite the American people entrusting Republicans with control of the House, which takes effect in just over one week, we were shut out of these negotiations. Speaker Pelosi's last hoorah is another reckless spending package that makes inflation even worse, fails to address the border crisis, and prioritizes green energy lobbyists over American oil & gas workers. A Victory to Secure Our Southern Border In a victory for border security efforts, legislation I authored alongside U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) has become law. H.R. 4209, the DHS Illicit Cross-Border Tunnel Defense Act , was included in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2023 and signed into law this morning. Our bill will help seal the more than 230 underground tunnels beneath the U.S.-Mexico border that drug cartels and human traffickers are currently using to smuggle narcotics, weapons, and cash through. Now, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will have the tools and resources they need to develop a plan, destroy the tunnels, and prevent these dangerous products from flowing into Texas. I am proud to see this bill become signed into law and will continue the fight to secure our border. Read more about this legislation here. Honoring Midland World War II Veteran and Volunteer I had the opportunity to honor Midland local and World War II Veteran Don McSparran in a speech on the Floor of the U.S. House of Representatives this morning. In addition to his military service, Mr. McSparran has volunteered with the Midland Police Department for the past twenty-two years, impacting countless lives and strengthening the community. On December 1st, Midland Mayor Patrick Payton officially declared the day 'Don McSparran Appreciation Day' - a wonderful time to recognize Mr. McSparran's lifetime of service and incredible dedication to our community. Thank you to all the volunteers working to keep our communities safe. Our district is blessed to have wonderful people caring for our community. Watch my remarks by clicking here or below. Accountability for the CCP The United States should not enable Chinese surveillance companies that help the Chinese Communist Party track and monitor dissidents, harvest genomic data, and torture ethnic and religious minorities. ﻿ Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-directed tech companies Hikvision, Dahua, Tiandy, and BGI provide the technological equipment used by the CCP to commit genocide against Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR). To hold these companies responsible for their human rights abuses, Florida Senator Marco Rubio and I introduced the Uyghur Human Rights Sanctions Review Act . The bill would require the U.S. Department of the Treasury to immediately make sanctions determinations for Hikvision, Dahua, Tiandy, and BGI. Read more here. Exposing CDC Censorship of Defensive Gun Data The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has removed its study regarding defensive gun use (DGU) information from its website. This study showed that Americans have relied on guns for self-defense upwards of 2.5 million times a year. This censorship follows a private meeting held between the CDC and gun control advocates. This is clear pandering to liberal activist groups aiming to cover up the fact gun owners use their 2nd amendment rights to protect their life, liberty, and property. Public trust in the CDC is already at an all-time low. If agencies commissioned with informing the American public are so easily swayed by political-interest groups, they will lose all credibility with the American people. The politicization of our institutions must end. I sent a letter with Rep. Elise Stefanik to the CDC demanding answers for this censorship. Come January, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives will advocate for law-abiding gun owners and ensure the CDC is held accountable. Read our letter here . Praise Report Praise God! Our family got the best early Christmas present ever. My father Walter is back home in San Angelo after being in the hospital for several months. His first request after landing in San Angelo was Rosa's Cafe. My family and I want to say thank you to the thousands of prayer warriors who have been relentless in praying for and sending support and love to my family, especially my dad and mom. We are so grateful for the wonderful support of our community and are overjoyed to have my dad home this Christmas. Volunteering with Our Family Earlier this week, my family and I were honored to partner with TXU Energy and the Concho Valley Community Action Agency to help those currently experiencing homelessness by spending time together and providing them with blankets and water bottle bundles. Particularly for my daughters, I was grateful to have the opportunity to share the gifts that we have been given with others. I want to encourage everyone to take some time this season to take stock of your blessings, as we're surrounded by our loved ones and in the comforts of our homes, let us keep in mind our neighbors and those less fortunate in our community. ﻿In Matthew 25:40, God instructs: ""Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.""

On Election Day November 8th, the American people gave the Republicans a chance to do something about this inflationary crisis, lets see if the squander it. Now, Democrats have decided that they don't care about the concerns of their voters, and are ramming through yet another bloated spending bill. And how bloated is it? The omnibus was passed today at 2 PM EST which included a 9% increase in discretionary spending from last fiscal year. That's the exact opposite of what the doctor ordered to deal with only is the bill massive, but it fails to address several key areas of need for our country. The omnibus only adds 300 new Border Patrol agents, while we are in the midst of an incredibly high flood of illegal immigrates. The bill also adds spending for Democrats' Green New Deal priorities, while not fully funding our needs in increasing domestic energy production. This shows where the Democrats' priorities are. They would rather fund their pie-in-the-sky ""renewable"" energy programs instead of ramping up oil production, which would lower gas prices, or increasing the Border Patrol to try and end the massive numbers of illegal immigrants and drugs like fentanyl that are killing our youth in record numbers. While it does include plenty of money for border security it's just that none of those borders they want to reinforce are in our country. Overall, this omnibus is another wasteful spending bill, but what the American people need is lower prices. This bill does not address the root causes of inflation, and will worsen the current inflationary crisis.

228," Weekly Report December 23, 2022 Dear Friends, I wish you and your families a beautiful Christmas, and to those who don't celebrate this holiday, may the blessings of this season be yours. I'm leaving Washington after a busy final legislative week of the year and heading home to celebrate Christmas with my family. I'm proud to finish what has been one of the most productive Congresses in U.S. history, including yesterday's passage of a bill that funds the government and will improve the lives of American communities coast to coast. Funding the Government The bipartisan Consolidated Appropriations Act is a package of 12 bills that fund every federal agency through the end of fiscal year 2023. I was able to secure $23.16 million in the legislation for 15 community projects in San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz Counties which will pay for more affordable housing, fix roads, build Caltrain crossings, and improve our schools. The projects for our community include: $3.25 million for housing $2,500,00 for the Sure Stay Hotel in San Jose to provide transitional housing for individuals experiencing homelessness. $750,000 to acquire, rehabilitate, and convert the 67-unit Crestview Hotel in Mountain View into permanent supportive housing. $8.5 million for Caltrain crossings $4 million for the Middle Avenue Pedestrian/Bicycle Undercrossing project to build a tunnel under the Caltrain tracks to improve pedestrian safety in Menlo Park. $2.5 million for a bicycle/pedestrian undercrossing at the Caltrain crossing at the intersection of Evelyn Avenue and Bernardo Avenue in Mountain View. $2 million to support planning and design for eight Caltrain grade separation projects in Santa Clara County north of Diridon Station: four in Palo Alto, two in Mountain View, and two in Sunnyvale. $6.62 million to improve transportation safety $1.52 million for a pedestrian path to connect downtown Saratoga with Hakone Gardens for pedestrians to safely access the gardens without walking along a dangerous stretch of Highway 9. $1.5 million to construct new sidewalks and improve pedestrian safety and accessibility in downtown Boulder Creek. $2 million to extend an existing bike lane on Highway 1 near Frenchman's Creek Road in Half Moon Bay. $800,000 to resurface streets in the Sharp Park Priority Development Area in Pacifica, which has some of the worst pavement conditions in the entire Bay Area. $800,000 to build safety fencing to prevent deaths by suicide along the Caltrain corridor. $1.6 million for education $1 million for a digital equity pilot program to provide broadband internet service to students and families in the Lakeside School District and Loma Prieta School District in Santa Clara County. $644,000 to provide mental health screening for fifth and sixth graders at Campbell Union Elementary School District. $2.75 million for Santa Cruz Mountain Communities $2 million for design, planning, permitting, and site acquisition for a new wastewater system in Boulder Creek. The project will assist survivors of the CZU fire, protect the watershed, and improve water quality to enhance endangered species recovery. $750,000 to replace the play structure at Skypark in Scotts Valley. The current play structure is worn and failing, and the funding will allow the City to build a new play structure to better serve children of differing abilities. $400,000 for outdoor trails $400,000 to construct the Spooky Knoll Trail Project in El Sereno Open Space Preserve near Lexington Reservoir in Los Gatos. The project will connect existing trails in El Sereno with a planned Highway 17 overcrossing and trails on the other side of Highway 17. A Visit from War-Torn Ukraine On December 26, 1941, amid the second World War, Winston Churchill stood before Congress and delivered a speech that would rally the nation behind the fight for democracy. This week, 81 years later, another wartime hero delivered a historic address to Congress with democracy on the line-Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. Over the last ten months, President Zelenskyy's brave, heroic leadership has rallied the Ukrainian people and the world to fight back against Russia's brutal, unlawful invasion of Ukraine. President Zelenskyy reminded Congress and the American people that the fight for Ukraine is the fight for Democracy itself: ""Your money is not charity. It's an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way."" Following his speech, Congress passed $44.9 billion in additional aid for Ukraine, including military, economic, and humanitarian aid. This aid will help Ukraine advance into the new year and bring victory to the Ukrainian people and a victory of democracy for the world. I'm proud to have voted for every effort in support of democracy and the Ukrainian people. We can never be exhausted of democracy. PASSED: ARPA-H and Diversity in Clinical Trials I'm very proud that the Consolidated Appropriations Act also included two major health bills I authored in this Congress, the ARPA-H Act and the DEPICT Act . The ARPA-H Act establishes the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, a groundbreaking new health agency with a mighty mission: curing and treating the world's deadliest diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Modeled after DARPA which paved the way for technology that built the world we live in today (GPS and the internet), ARPA-H will lead to breakthroughs in health that many never imagined possible. Modeled after DARPA which paved the way for technology that built the world we live in today (GPS and the internet), ARPA-H will lead to breakthroughs in health that many never imagined possible. For the first time in U.S. history, the DEPICT Act will establish a statutory requirement for diversity in clinical trial participants. Diverse clinical trials are essential to ensure that biomedical research is robust and equitable so that all Americans can be confident that treatments work for them, regardless of their backgrounds. We're finally making good science the rule, not the recommendation. January 6 th Committee Report After a thorough investigation and nine riveting public hearings, the bipartisan Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 th Attack on the U.S. Capitol released its final report outlining the former President's plot to subvert our democracy and halt the peaceful transfer of power. In an unprecedented decision, the Committee referred the former President to the Justice Department for possible criminal charges, including obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the government, and inciting or assisting an insurrection. Those who attacked our democracy and our system of constitutional government must be held accountable. No one is above the law. You can read the Committee's final report here . Former President's Tax Returns After nearly four years of failed legal challenges from the former President, the Ways and Means Committee voted this week to release his tax returns. This effort would not have been necessary if the former President released his tax returns when he ran for office, just as every major candidate from both parties has for the past 40 years. Trump's refusal to follow this bipartisan tradition shows why Congress should pass my legislation, the Presidential Tax Transparency Act , requiring every presidential candidate to disclose their tax returns before they're elected. The American people must be confident that their president works in the public interest, not for their own financial gain. You can view the Ways and Means Committee's report here . Cotoni-Coast Dairies In 2015, I led efforts in Congress to protect the Cotoni-Coast Dairies, home to picturesque coastal terraces, 500 acres of redwood forest, six watersheds, and four known Native American archeological sites on the Coast of our congressional district. Last week, the Santa Cruz Mountains Trail Stewardship released these stunning images of the new trails they're building at the National Monument so it can be opened to hikers, cyclists, and on-leash dogs. President Obama formally established the National Monument in January of 2017, and I'm thrilled that the public will be able to experience this great natural treasure. It is deeply gratifying for me to protect these lands forever and that future generations will benefit from what we pass on to them. Earthquake Safety On Tuesday, a deadly 6.5 magnitude earthquake hit northern California in Humboldt County, killing two people and injuring eleven. My heart is with our fellow Californians as they recover from the losses and damage of the disaster. This was a stark reminder that the best time to prepare for any disaster is before it happens. Visit to learn how you can prepare and best tips to stay safe during an earthquake. Letters Anna Sent This Week Immigrant Workers Affected by Tech Layoffs In 2022, more than 140,000 tech workers lost their jobs, with approximately 50,000 tech sector job losses in November alone. Foreign-born workers comprise nearly a quarter of the STEM workforce, and many of these newly unemployed workers are on H-1Bs or other employment-based visas. These individuals only have 60 days to find a new employer to sponsor their visa, and those who are unable to do so must leave the country. I sent a letter this week asking the Biden Administration to extend the grace period to 120 days for laid-off foreign-born workers to find new jobs before losing their employment-based visas. Throughout our country's history, immigrants have been the driving force behind the innovation and entrepreneurship that has made the American economy the largest and most prosperous in the world. In fact, more than half of all billion-dollar technology companies were founded by immigrants. To ensure that the successful companies of the future are based in the U.S., we must prevent this brain drain from taking place. Read my letter here . Covid-19 Vaccines Last Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released two new studies showing the bivalent Covid-19 vaccine reduces the risk of hospitalization. The first CDC study showed that people who received the bivalent vaccine had 57% less risk of hospitalization than unvaccinated people and 45% less risk of hospitalization than people who had received two to four doses of the original vaccine and received their last shot 11 or more months earlier. The second study showed that older adults who received the updated booster had 84% less risk of hospitalization than unvaccinated people and 73% less risk than people who received at least two doses of the original vaccine. Despite this strong protection, only 14% of people aged 5 and older have received the updated booster.

229," Dear Neighbor, It's been a busy last few weeks in Washington, and as this Congressional term comes to a close, I'm reflecting on what a privilege it has been to represent Rockland and Westchester in Congress. I'm so proud of everything I have been able to deliver for working families in our district, and across the country. Just this week, in the Fiscal Year 2023 omnibus appropriations bill, I secured nearly $29 million for 15 different community projects in our district-and this is on top of the $8.2 million in community project funding I delivered earlier this year, for a total of $37 million across 24 community projects. Here are the new projects that will receive funding as part of the Fiscal Year 2023 appropriations bill: One of the highlights of my term has been to secure essential funding for our communities. I recently met with local leaders in Yorktown to discuss how these investments-like the $1.2 million I delivered for environmental restoration and infrastructure improvements in Yorktown around Sparkle Lake-will benefit the daily lives of families throughout our district. Press conference announcing $1.2 million for sewer project in Yorktown. I'm so glad that my Democratic colleagues and I have passed a government funding package this Congress before control of the House flips in January. This important legislation provides critical resources to keep the federal government working for working families like yours. It delivers billions of dollars in funding for child care and early learning like Head Start; SNAP benefits to reduce food insecurity; health care for our veterans; and education programs, including increased Pell Grant awards and Title I-A grants for public schools. This legislation also includes another consequential round of security, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine as we continue to support their fight for democracy. And it protects our democracy here at home by reforming the Electoral Count Act of 1887 to reduce the likelihood of another disgraceful attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power like we saw on January 6th. This consequential funding package reminds me of the extraordinary progress for working families Democrats made when we passed the American Rescue Plan Act nearly two years ago. When I first got to Washington at the height of the pandemic, many folks in our community were struggling to access vital health resources and get food on the table. I worked with my Democratic colleagues to pass the American Rescue Plan Act to help get families back on their feet-sending out much-needed economic relief and vastly expanding the availability of vaccines, at no cost, to keep everyone safe. Rep. Jones announced that he secured Rockland's first mass vaccination site at Rockland Community College in April 2021. I was proud to help bring home billions of dollars for New York State as part of the American Rescue Plan Act , including for small businesses, public schools, and local governments right here in our district. In that legislation, we also expanded the Child Tax Credit, which cut child poverty nearly in half nationwide. This legislation uplifted working families at a time of great need-but I didn't stop there. I played a key role in passing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to repair our roads and bridges, invest in our infrastructure's climate resiliency, and create millions of good-paying jobs. And we passed the CHIPS and Science Act to strengthen our supply chain and lower costs. Roundtable discussion on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act with local community leaders. And this summer, Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act , which will help bring down sky-high prescription drug prices for Medicare recipients, lower health care costs, expand health care coverage, and tackle the climate crisis with the largest investment in climate action our nation has seen. In Rockland and Westchester alone, this legislation will lower insurance premiums and cap out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for thousands of Medicare recipients. I even helped lead the charge to get President Biden to use his executive authority to cancel student debt, and now his student debt cancellation program will cancel up to $20,000 per borrower making under $125,000 - providing life-changing economic relief for millions of Americans crushed by student debt in our broken economy, including thousands of people in our congressional district. Amid all of this, I've worked to defend our most fundamental rights-from voting rights to marriage equality to abortion care and contraception-from the threat presented by the far-right, 6-3 Supreme Court majority. My bill with Representative Jerry Nadler, the Respect for Marriage Act , was just signed into law by President Biden. It will make marriage equality the law of the land to prevent discrimination against same-sex and interracial couples by states and the federal government. As one of only nine openly gay members in the House, this fight is personal to me. Recently, I introduced and passed legislation to rename the post office in Suffern, NY the Sergeant Gerald T. ""Jerry"" Donnellan Post Office. Sergeant Donnellan was a light in our community, leading a life of service to others, both in the military and as an advocate for veterans health care and wellbeing later in his life-and I'm so proud to honor him in this way. Constituent Services Casework is at the core of my office's mission, and my team has been able to resolve approximately 5,000 cases this term. Whether someone is struggling to navigate complex government agencies, like the IRS, or needs help getting their loved ones around the world the proper authorization to come to the United States, I am honored to serve my constituents and help their families resolve these issues and access the resources they need to thrive. We've had a lot to celebrate this year-both in our district, and across our nation-and it has made me so proud to be your champion in Congress. I've successfully navigated a gridlocked Washington to deliver real change for working families, and it means so much to bring these results home to the community that raised me. But above all, what I want you to know is this: I'm not going anywhere. There is still so much work to do, so my fight on behalf of you is far from over. In fact, it has only just begun.

230,"Having trouble viewing this email? View it as a Web page [ ]. Header FINAL December 23, 2022 Dear friend, We marked the end of 2022 in Congress by passing a *government funding package [ ]*, also known as the omnibus. This legislation includes many victories for San Diego, including language to allow for the Environmental Protection Agency to transfer funds to the International Boundary and Water Commission to tackle cross-boundary water pollution. The bill also includes funding for 14 community projects I advocated for, totaling *$33,764,000* for CA-52! The end of this year also means I say goodbye to neighborhoods that will become part of new congressional districts in 2023. I will miss serving these places and look forward to getting to know the new communities of CA-50. For a summary of my work in Congress in 2022, *click here.* [ ] As we get together with loved ones, it's important to stay safe and up to date with COVID-19 and flu vaccines. For more information on how to protect yourself and others, *visit the CDC website.* [ ] Below is another update on the work my staff and I have done recently to serve you. ________________________________________________________________________ This Week's Casework Story Hema from San Diego contacted my office in November regarding an issue with her social security benefits. Due to overpayment, SSA had stopped her monthly payments to recover the money. My staff submitted an inquiry to find out if the problem was resolved. This month, SSA notified my office that Hema will be receiving $2,481 a month in SSA benefits. ________________________________________________________________________ President Zelenskyy Addresses Joint Meeting of Congress to Urge Support for Ukraine zelenskyy house floor On Tuesday, I attended a joint meeting of Congress to hear Ukrainian President Zelenskyy speak on the House floor. During his *inspiring speech* [ ], he highlighted the ongoing need for American support as Ukraine continues facing Russian aggression. Most importantly, he said that money from the U.S. is not charity; it's an investment in our global security. Standing with Ukraine means standing for democracy. It was an honor to have President Zelenskyy in Congress for him to share his powerful message. ________________________________________________________________________ Giving Back this Holiday Season PATH DO volunteers On Wednesday, members of my district staff volunteered at PATH San Diego.

233," Folks, it's that time of year. The holiday season is always a time to reflect. It gives us the opportunity to look back at all we did this year as we rest up and get ready for the next one. So, I've been doing some thinking about what we got done this year, and I wanted to share with you the highlights that came to mind when it comes to defending Montana and this country. Don't forget, I do this work in the Senate because Montanans sent me there to do it. You folks are my bosses, so it's important that you-most of all-know what I'm up to. Jon's 2022 Highlights Honoring Our Promises to Veterans: As Chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I'm very proud of our work this year to honor the promises made to our men and women in uniform. Montana is home to so many veterans, and all year we were working hard to pass new laws that'll help those Montana vets access their hard-earned health care and benefits more easily and efficiently. We also took major steps to expand mental health care and suicide prevention efforts at VA, and to connect more Native veterans with these life-saving resources. Most notably- and this is a highlight for both 2022 and my entire time in the Senate -was passage of the PACT Act. This game-changing bill was decades in the making, and while it took one hell of a fight to get across the finish line, I couldn't be prouder to say we're finally delivering toxic-exposed veterans the health care and benefits they deserve. Slashing Prescription Drug Prices: Politicians have been talking about tackling skyrocketing prescription drug prices for years, but this was the year we finally got it done. We took steps to require Medicare to negotiate drug prices so multinational pharmaceutical companies won't be able to price gouge seniors anymore. We also capped out-of-pocket drug costs and the cost of insulin for Medicare recipients so folks could have more stability. It's a big win for Montana's seniors, and we did it while paying down the debt by holding the richest corporations accountable. Defending Our National Security: It's impossible to underscore how important it is that Congress finally passed a full-year government funding bill. This bill strengthens rural America, in Montana's schools and small businesses, in our national security and border security, in Yellowstone's recovery from this summer's historic flooding, and too much more to name (but you can click the link for more details). I was proud to spearhead the largest share of the budget as Defense Chairman, and I'm even prouder we got the whole thing done. Supporting Law Enforcement and Public Safety: Two of the biggest things I pushed for in the budget were boosting public safety and better supporting the folks who keep us safe. That means an increase in resources for Border Patrol, anti-drug taskforces, and our local and Tribal police departments. That means a pay raise for our troops. And that means a boost in resources to tackle the epidemic of violence against women and the MMIP crisis. While negotiating the national defense bill and the government funding package, I was especially proud to include my bills to specifically target and combat fentanyl trafficking, as well as my bills to do right by our firefighters and first responders who get hurt in the line of duty. Boosting American Manufacturing Jobs: The CHIPS and Science Act doesn't get talked about enough, but it's one of the most important pieces of legislation we passed this year. This bipartisan bill is all about maintaining our competitive edge over China and ensuring we are no longer reliant on foreign adversaries for tools and technology that are *essential* to everyday life. Practically everything with an on/off switch needs a semiconductor chip-from your tv remote to your tractor to the missile defense system at your nearest military base. By making those chips in America, we're making our country safer and creating a whole lot of American manufacturing jobs in the process. Standing Up for Montana Producers: It's no secret that the lack of competition in the ag industry is hurting Montana's family farmers and ranchers. Between four big packers controlling north of 85% of meat processing and major manufacturers preventing farmers from fixing their own equipment, both producers and consumers are getting ripped off. While there's still work to do to undo decades of ag consolidation, we took major steps towards leveling the playing field. From expanding local meat processing capacity to improving water and internet infrastructure so folks can always access what they need, we're making targeted investments that'll inject more competition in the marketplace and improve prices for both producers and consumers. And when the Biden Administration proposed a new ""climate disclosure rule,"" I raised Montanans' concerns and got a commitment on the record that any actions would not burden our family farmers and ranchers. Protecting the Postal Service: Montanans know how vital the Postal Service is to our rural communities. We rely on the USPS for delivering everything from prescription medications to Social Security benefits to essential services for small businesses. But the sad fact is, some folks have long wanted to privatize mail delivery to enrich themselves, and those folks worked for years to steadily run the USPS into the ground. But in the first half of the year, I joined several of my colleagues in reaching across the aisle to make critical changes through the Postal Service Reform Act. This bipartisan legislation put the Postal Service back on solid financial ground and set stronger standards for mail delivery and services so Montana families and businesses can continue to depend on the USPS for years to come. Listening to YOU: Last but certainly not least, it's been a highlight for me ever since I was first elected to get to meet with Montanans every single week. But this year was a bit more notable. After a couple long pandemic years, I was finally able to resume my in-person town halls and meet more Montanans eyeball-to-eyeball than in the smaller meetings and virtual meetings that dominated the last two years. And when in Washington, it's brought me a whole lot of joy to see Montana school groups and Montana advocates fill the Capitol once again. This year in particular, I'm not taking this highlight for granted. Now the year may be ending, but the work is certainly not. Whether it's cutting costs across the board, continuing to expand health care access, tackling ag consolidation, or making our country safer-I'm ready to get to work this coming Congress to keep improving lives across our great state. I hope you'll join me in that work. Here's to 2023! |   ",Tester

235," Gooden Opposes Democrat Spending Bill Friday, December 23, 2022 WASHINGTON - On Friday, Congress passed a $1.7 trillion spending bill that will fund the government through September 2023. Congressman Lance Gooden (R-Texas) voted against this legislation and released the following statement: Rep. Gooden said , ""Senate Republicans who supported the Democrats' $1.7 trillion spending bill have completely stolen the new House majority's leverage next Congress and given Joe Biden an early Christmas present. I proudly voted against this legislation because it fails to secure our own border while simultaneously providing millions to help foreign nations secure theirs. The bill passed today is the very definition of America Last."" The ""Omnibus"" bill, as it is called, included funding for a list of Democrat pet projects, including $3.6 million for the ""Michelle Obama Trail,"" nearly a million for ""LGBT and gender nonconforming housing,"" and a huge increase for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms so the agency may continue its gun-grabbing agenda. In addition, this bill provides over $400 million to help countries like Jordan and Egypt secure their borders, while explicitly preventing DHS from securing our own. Lastly, the legislation removes the incoming Republican majority's ability to defund the IRS's 87,000 new agents or curtail the Department of Justice's attacks on conservatives. For these reasons, Congressman Gooden opposed the legislation. The government funding bill ultimately passed the United States Senate on Thursday with the support of 18 Senate Republicans. The House of Representative subsequently advanced the bill by a vote of 225-201. President Biden is expected to sign the Omnibus into law tonight.

I joined Tucker Carlson Tonight on Wednesday night to discuss the omnibus monstrosity: My team and I worked overtime to read through the omnibus bill so that we could expose some of the most egregious provisions contained within. We highlighted some of the many, many, instances of wasteful spending and problematic provisions. Whether it's $65 million for salmon, $3.6 million for the ""Michelle Obama Trail,"" or $400,000 for the Racial Justice Improvement Project, this bill contains every liberal pet project under the sun. CLICK HERE TO READ THREAD I highly encourage you to take a few minutes to read through the thread, linked above. The bill prohibits CBP operational funding from being used to secure our own border but includes $410 million for border security in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia and Oman. There's even a Malthusian measure for hundreds of millions in ""family planning"" to protect ""biodiversity."" READ: Republican slams $575M funding for family planning to protect biodiversity in omnibus In addition to the millions wasted in the Middle East, Congress is allocating an additional $47 billion for Ukraine and authorizes a ""Ukrainian Independence Park"" right in Washington, DC. Even Twitter and Tesla CEO Elon Musk weighed in to voice his concerns on this outrageous waste. Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and the lobbyists and Democrat staffers who wrote this bill hoped that no one would actually read it. As long as I have the privilege to serve you in Congress, I will always fight for transparency and sanity in Washington. To do otherwise and support the broken system would be an affront to every American.

237," Visit Our Website Media Voting Against the $1.7 Trillion Wasteful, Inflationary Spending Package Yesterday, I joined Neil Cavuto on FOX Business to discuss my vote against the $1.7 trillion wasteful, inflationary spending package that just passed the U.S. Senate. You can click HERE or on the image below to watch my full interview. Among the wasteful provisions in the $1.7 trillion package are: $47 billion deficit spending to fund the war in Ukraine $3.2 billion to continue processing and releasing illegal migrants at a faster pace and larger scale. $800 million for grants for liberal cities like New York, Washington, D.C., and Chicago to receive illegal aliens. $1.6 million for the Leahy Center in Vermont, named after Sen. Patrick Leahy, the member who requested the earmark. $750,000 for ""LGBT and Gender Non-Conforming housing"" in Albany, New York. $750,000 for the ""TransLatin@ Coalition"" to provide ""workforce development programs and supportive services for Transgender and Gender nonconforming and Intersex (TGI) immigrant women in Los Angeles."" $3.6 million for a Michelle Obama Trail in Georgia. $1.7 billion for ATF to enforce regulations that will take away Americans 2 nd Amendment rights. $83 billion total emergency appropriations that are also not paid for with spending offsets in the regular budget $2 billion in defense funding for clean energy investments $3 million for the American LGBTQ+ Museum in New York City $2.3 million to encourage student loan holders to enroll in the Biden administration's illegal loan cancellation scheme $370 billion on Green New Deal style handouts to ""green"" industries $1.2 million for ""LGBTQIA+ Pride Centers"" $1.2 million for ""support services for DACA recipients"" at San Diego Community College $1 million for Zora's House in Ohio, a ""coworking and community space"" for ""women and gender-expansive people of color."" $1.5 million for the COVID-19 American History Project $3.5 million to fund the Office of Diversity and Inclusion in Congress. $1.5 billion in taxpayer funding for something called the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Health (ARPA-H). Designates a ""Ukrainian Independence Park"" in Washington, D.C. An extra $212.1 million to the DOJ to further prosecutions J6 defendants and investigate and charge hundreds more. $410 million to ""remain available"" to reimburse Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia and Oman for ""enhanced border security."" At least $150 million of that must go to Jordan, according to the bill. $575 million in a global health section allocated for ""family planning/reproductive health, including in areas where population growth threatens biodiversity or endangered species."" This Christmas Season, Give Thanks to Kansas Farmers and Ranchers Christmas is a season of giving. In Kansas, however, giving isn't unique to the holidays. Kansas farmers and ranchers give their time and talents 365 days a year to ensure people here at home and around the world have food, fuel and fiber to power their lives. It is because of their giving spirit that we can all enjoy the food and festivities we have come to love during this special time of year. I recently visited Mill Dam Christmas Tree farm in Fredonia. While walking among the new crop of Christmas trees with owner Shelia Steel, it became obvious how much the family has invested into this great tree farm. The amount of time they give around the holidays to ensure that families across southeast Kansas can have a traditional Christmas experience of cutting down and taking home a real Christmas tree is unmatched. The Steeles are just one of 69 different Christmas tree farms located in Kansas and more than 400 registered agritourism businesses in the state offering unique on-farm experiences. Kansas farmers deserve to know we appreciate their year-round hard work, and I recently wrote about this in the Topeka Capital-Journal. You may click HERE or on the image below to read my full op-ed.

As your Congresswoman, here are 19 BIG WINS I proudly secured for you and communities throughout Maine's 1st district just this month: $5 million to aid farmers impacted by PFAS ""forever chemical"" contamination. While Maine has led the nation in testing and responding to PFAS contamination on farmland, there is no question that farmers in other states will be affected. More aid will be needed but this is a critical first step to support Maine farmers grappling with this crisis. After years of advocacy, the York River will now officially be designated as 'Wild & Scenic' . The designation opens communities along the York River to new technical assistance and federal funding, and provides a local forum for the watershed communities to collaboratively address the river's long-term stewardship needs. Acting together, Governor Mills and our bipartisan congressional delegation secured a lifeline for Maine's lobster industry by enacting a regulatory pause on misguided federal regulations. $45 million in long-awaited funding to address severe erosion at Camp Ellis . Camp Ellis and the surrounding Saco community have endured an extremely long wait for this funding. For 14 years, my staff and I have worked with the City of Saco and the residents of Camp Ellis to shore-up this beloved area. As a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I also proudly secured direct funding for 15 projects totaling $34.5 Million in Maine's 1st District. These projects include: $500,000 for the Alfond Youth Center in Waterville for targeted support to children and families in need $535,000 for Amistad in Portland for supportive recovery housing $750,000 for Apex Youth Connection in Biddeford for its youth job readiness center focused on at-risk youth $12,326,000 for Bigelow Laboratory in East Boothbay for its new Ocean Sciences Innovation and Education Wing $3 million for the Maine Irish Heritage Center in Portland for building restoration $1 million for the Central Lincoln County YMCA Child Care Center in Damariscotta in for renovations and expansion $3,452,978 for the City of Saco for its water resource resilience project $3 million for the Goodall Memorial Library in Sanford for renovations and expansion $2,105,000 for the Knox Clinic in Rockland for construction and outfitting of a new facility $1 million for Northern Light Mercy Hospital in Portland for language acquisition and health care workforce training $1 million for the Preble Street Food Security Hub in South Portland to support its anti-hunger work $2,750,000 for the Governor's Energy Office for energy efficiency workforce training and support $1 million for the Town of Limerick for its water and sewer mains replacement project $1,500,000 for Boots2Roots in Portland for its veteran-focused transition to work initiative $619,000 for the Greater Portland Immigrant Welcome Center for a new women's entrepreneurship program Thanks to all of you for helping to make this year one to celebrate.

240," Worth the wait! FY23 funding passes Email not displaying correctly? Click here. This week in Congress December 23, 2022 Worth the wait! FY23 appropriation passes: Permanent 83% federal Medicaid $26.8m for community projects More nutrition assistance More funds for drinkable water School aid, Pell grants up $15.5m to cut electric costs NMI a ""state"" for election grants In other news: Aldans visit Welcome to Alex Megino Free COVID tests again available Tinian office moves KILILI TIME CAPSULE OPPORTUNITIES HIGHLIGHTS Tottots, Canaries celebrate the season . The Northern Mariana Islands Christmas tree at the White House is decorated this year by students from Dandan Middle School and San Vicente Elementary School. It is an annual tradition for students from each state and territory and from the U.S. federal school system to add their ornaments to the 58 trees that encircle the national Christmas tree in President's Park . Thank you, Tottots and Canaries, for representing our islands so well. Worth the wait! ﻿ FY23 funding passes The House passed today a $1.7 trillion spending bill for fiscal year 2023, containing a permanent increase in federal Medicaid funding for the Marianas and over $26 million for community projects I requested. The Senate passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 on Thursday. The White House has said President Biden will sign the bill. The appropriations act comes three months after the beginning of fiscal 2023, but is well worth the wait. Here are highlights particularly important to the people of the Marianas: Scratch temporary. The ""temporary"" increase in the federal share of Medicaid to 83 percent becomes permanent with enactment of the fiscal year 2023 appropriation act, saving the Commonwealth millions of dollars every year and ensuring a steady revenue stream for the Commonwealth Health Center. Permanent 83% for federal Medicaid The federal government will permanently cover 83 percent of the cost of Medicaid in the Marianas under terms of the fiscal year 2023 appropriation act now on its way to President Biden for signature. The 83 percent federal share for the Marianas is the highest for any state or territory and has been in place on a temporary basis since 2019. Without today's spending bill the federal share would drop to 55 percent, costing the Commonwealth an estimated $40 million and threatening services at the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation, which depends on Medicaid for 37 percent of revenue . When I first took office in 2009, federal Medicaid funding was capped at $5 million and the Commonwealth had to match that money dollar-for-dollar. With passage of U.S. Public Law 116-94 in 2019, I was able to raise funding to $60 million with annual inflation increases. The 2019 law also lowered the required local match from 45 percent to 17 percent, with the federal government picking up the other 83 percent . But the change was only temporary, a problem today's legislation fixes. Ending fixed funding for Medicaid and giving the Marianas the most favorable federal/local match were two of my top goals in Congress and are now accomplished. I am especially grateful to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark, and Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Frank Pallone and their staff, who helped me make sure the 16,868 Marianas residents formally enrolled in Medicaid receive the healthcare they need.

The fourteen Marianas projects are worth $26,838,182. This is a substantial increase over the nine projects, worth $4.5 million, that I was able to get approved in fiscal 2022. That year, Democrats reinstated Members' ability to direct money to specific organizations and causes in our home districts. Republicans ended this congressionally directed funding in 2010, but have now reversed course and will allow Member funding when controlling the House next year. Thanks to all the organizations that submitted proposals to me for inclusion in the fiscal 2023 appropriation. I invite more project ideas from the Marianas community to submit to appropriators for fiscal 2024 funding. More nutrition assistance Marianas families and individuals enrolled in the Nutrition Assistance Program will benefit from the $34 million in food aid -$4 million more than last year-that I secured for NAP in the fiscal 2023 appropriation. When I entered Congress, Marianas annual NAP funding was stuck at just $10 million. But, year after year and through my seat on the House Agriculture Committee, I have been able to increase NAP benefits to reflect the high cost of food-especially on Rota and Tinian-and increase the number of eligible households. Inclusion of the Marianas in the national Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program remains my goal, as long as we can achieve that without any loss of the benefits and eligibility already achieved. Inclusion in SNAP will ensure that as economic conditions change or when disaster strikes, there will always be enough money to keep Marianas families fed. In addition to more NAP funding, the Consolidated Appropriations Act makes the Summer EBT program permanent, beginning in 2024. Through this program, Congress has provided Marianas families millions of dollars during the pandemic to help pay the cost of meals children would have received had they been attending school in-person. Last year, some 11,671 Marianas students were eligible for EBT benefits. More funds for drinkable water The fiscal 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act continues for the fourteenth year the 1.5 percent set-aside for the Marianas and other insular areas from Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act funds administered by the Environmental Protection Agency. I was first able to raise the set-aside for our areas to 1.5 percent in annual appropriations in 2010, though statutorily we are only eligible for 0.25 percent and 0.33 percent, respectively, from the two laws. This annual tweak in the funding formula has already resulted in over $86 million extra for the Marianas and brought 24-hour water to almost every household. The additional $7.2 million from today's bill will provide more help to reach our goal of drinkable water in every household within five years. School aid, ﻿Pell grants up Funding for the Marianas Public School System will go up an estimated $630,000 from the current $13,018,246 as a result of the increased appropriation for Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title I-A in the fiscal 2023 appropriation. As Chair of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education, I led the request signed by 107 other Members of Congress earlier this year asking to increase Title I grants-and appropriators listened. PSS continues to benefit from the formula change to increase insular area funding that I included in the 2015 Every Student Succeeds Act . Funding also increases in fiscal 2023 for special education (up 6 percent) and Head Start (up 9 percent). And Marianas college students will see as much as a $500 bump in their annual Pell grant for tuition and supplies. The maximum Pell grant will now be $7,395 . Energizing Insular Communities. Solar, wind, geothermal, and other local resources already produce 38 percent of electricity in Hawai'i , reducing reliance on expensive, imported oil. Here, sheep graze beneath solar panels on Kauai to maximize use of scarce island land. (Photo: NY Times) $15.5m to cut electric costs Funding for the Interior Department's Energizing Insular Communities program increases more than 40 percent, from $11 million to $15.5 million, in fiscal 2023 and insular technical assistance grants increase to $22.3 million. Both programs are funded at the level I requested . Energizing Insular Communities is intended to move us away from costly and dirty imported fossil fuels to cheaper, cleaner domestic sources of energy, such as solar and wind. I have been pushing to increase this line item and have gotten steady plus-ups each year. I remain unsatisfied, however, with the speed at which the Commonwealth is moving to reduce the cost of electricity for consumers. As they did at my request in fiscal 2022 and to ensure the most effective use of funds, appropriators again directed the Interior Department to update and implement energy action plans for the Marianas and other insular areas in compliance with U.S. Public Law 113-235 . FY23: NMI a ""state"" for election grants As a former Commonwealth Election Commission Executive Director and the first person from the Marianas elected to federal office, I want to make sure our island elections receive the same support as every other U.S. jurisdiction under the Help America Vote Act and other federal laws. The fiscal 2023 appropriation includes $75,000,000 for the federal Election Commission to make payments to ""states"" for improvements to election management and security-and the Marianas is deemed a state for purposes of this funding. With trust in elections under constant assault in our nation, we need to provide robust support to the local officials who bear the heavy responsibility of keeping our votes safe and vote counting reliable. Earlier this Congress, we included the Marianas for funding in the Protection and Advocacy for Voting Access Program Inclusion Act , Public Law 117-182, to help ensure full participation in elections by persons with disabilities. Welcome, Aldans. Kevin Bautista, Kaelani Demapan, Joshua Aldan, Keaun Aldan, Jodine Demapan and Staff Sergeant Kevin Aldan (l-r) visited their congressional office in Washington on Wednesday. The family is gathered to celebrate Jodine's graduation from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. The Aldans (Kevin, Jodine, Keaun and Joshua) currently live in Ft. Eustis, Virginia, where Kevin is stationed. Kevin Bautista and Jodine's sister Kaelani Demapan serve our Northern Marianas College in the Office of the President and at Project PROA, respectively. Thanks for stopping by and congratulations, Jodine! Free COVID tests again available In anticipation of a resurgence of COVID-19 as families and friends gather for the holiday season, the federal government is again providing free, at-home COVID tests to American households. When first offered earlier this year, the website for the free tests had trouble recognizing the post office box addresses most people in the Marianas use. Marianas residents finally received the free tests in the mail after your congressional office worked to correct those problems . This time around, the website seems to be accepting post office box addresses in the Marianas without issue. But, please, let your congressional office know if you do have a problem. To apply for the free tests-up to four per household-go to online or call 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489). Welcome to Alex Megino, who joins the Saipan District Office team as an intern. A graduate of Kagman High School this May, Mr. Megino is now pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Law and Paralegal Studies at the University of Cincinnati. His hobbies include reading science fiction, playing soccer, and studying digital art. Through his internship, Alex wants to learn more about how our constituents talk about and describe the issues that concern them; and he hopes to become part of the network of community members who work to solve those concerns. 1 Year Ago $999k for economic development ﻿ As part of the American Rescue Plan, the Northern Mariana Islands are receiving $999,755 for economic development planning, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce announced . To accelerate the territories' economic recovery from the pandemic, the funding will support local tourism, expand infrastructure and broadband. 5 Years Ago Crisis averted at BECQ Calling it a ""crisis"" earlier this year, Governor Ralph Torres and BECQ Administrator Frank Rabauliman said President Trump's proposal to cut spending at the Environmental Protection Agency would have ""direct and possibly irreversible effects on the environment and public health in the CNMI."" Fortunately, along with many members of Congress, I pushed back in our annual appropriation process by prioritizing EPA funding and blocked the President's cuts. 10 Years Ago NDAA passes with flag bill intact ﻿By a vote of 315-107 the House has approved the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act bill , including my amendment that requires the Armed Forces to display the flags of all the U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, whenever the flags of all 50 states are on display.

241," Visit My Website Facebook Twitter YouTube Contact Me Dear neighbor, The 117th Congress was one of the most productive legislative sessions in U.S. history. Over the last two years, Democrats have been hard-at-work passing historic, life-changing legislation for the American people. Shortly after President Biden came into office, he signed into law the American Rescue Plan, which has helped our nation recover from the COVID-19 pandemic by getting shots into arms, money into pockets, people in jobs, and children safely back in schools. Following that, Democrats signed the historic Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act into law, which is rebuilding crumbling roads, bridges, and highways; bringing broadband everywhere; putting EV charging stations across America; and creating millions of good-paying jobs now and for years to come. Then we enacted the CHIPS and Science Act, which is strengthening American supply chains, creating jobs, and will give America the edge in the 21st century economy. And most recently, we signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, transformative legislation to lower energy and health care costs, reduce the price of prescription drugs, and provide the largest investment in climate ever. And that's not all. Since President Biden took office, we've created 10.3 million jobs nationwide - the most in U.S. history. While I'm proud of what we've accomplished for the American people, I know we still have a lot of work to do to lower costs, create jobs, and make our communities safer. I look forward to continuing our work For the People and fighting on behalf of my constituents in the upcoming 118th session of the United States Congress. Below is an overview of the work my team and I have done this Congress to serve the people of California's 33rd District. WATCH: REP.

242," December 23, 2022 Friends, I hope you and your family are well! I wanted to provide you with a few updates regarding what's going on - Opposing the Omnibus Package The 4,155-page, $1.7 Trillion omnibus spending package has been the main legislative item of the week. I actively discouraged Senate Republicans from voting for the package, but ultimately they approved it by a vote of 68-29. The bill then came over to the House, where I voted NO. Unfortunately, the bill still managed to pass by a vote of 225-201 and now heads to the President. Since 1954, control of the House of Representatives has flipped between parties five times. In not a single instance has Congress passed a lame-duck omnibus before the new majority takes power. There was no reason for the Senate to change that tradition this year. Quite frankly, the content of this omnibus package is absolute garbage. The most telling aspect of it is the more people learn what's in it, the less popular it becomes. That's why it was crafted in secret behind closed doors and released around Christmas when they hoped the public wouldn't pay attention. From my perspective, the bill is only a ""victory"" for politicians who want to spend money. If you're someone who believes in fiscal responsibility or that the legislative branch should use spending authority as a check on the excesses of the Executive Branch, you're going to hate this bill. For starters, it spends $134 billion over last year's ""discretionary"" spending levels. That's $134 billion or a 9% spending increase on just the traditional day-to-day funding of the government. This is in addition to the trillions in one-time spending that was pushed through on a purely partisan basis through the reconciliation process over the past two years, and doesn't include ""mandatory"" spending like the hundreds of billions we spend a year on paying interest in our national debt. The Democrats' spending spree was going to trigger a round of automatic spending cuts that we were going to have to deal with next Congress. This would have also given us another opportunity to fight to undo some of the inflation-driving government spending damage pushed by the Biden Administration. But this bill pushes off the automatic cuts, depriving us of another chance to cut spending next Congress. Not to mention, The Heritage Foundation projects that the total package would increase the 10-year deficit by $2.65 trillion, or $20,000 per household. There's a lot more I can and will say about this bill, but let me conclude by saying this: I don't see any policy wins for Republicans in this bill. Instead of a fiscally-responsible spending bill, the package we have seems more like a massive vanity project for a bunch of lame-duck Senators who are no longer accountable to the people who elected them. I will continue to fight back against reckless spending and promote common sense policies every chance I get. Merry Christmas to South Carolina!

244," News from Congressman Jake Ellzey Home About Contact Media Services Dear  , Recent News In the last couple of months, a lot has happened here in Washington, DC. Most notably, we recently passed the fiscal year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, which is the bill that continues to fund our military. In my view, this is one of the most important bills we work on here in Congress. The continued support of the military is crucial to maintain our national security and the safety of our citizens. Today, Congress passed a disastrous 1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill that does little to help our country. Again, the Democrats introduced and passed a 4,000-page bill in the middle of the night without committee work or input from members outside of leadership. This is not the way to govern our country, and when Republicans take control of the House in January, we will govern the way our founders intended. With honesty and transparency. As we look forward to January and the 118th Congress, I am optimistic for the New Year now that we have control of the House. I am confident that House Republicans will produce legislation that will benefit the American people. We will work tirelessly to bring back security and order to our border, we will reign in government spending bringing inflation under control, and we will put the hardworking American people first again through our Commitment to America plan. So, with that, Merry Christmas, and Happy New year, enjoy the time off with your family and loved ones and reflect on this past year and what you are most grateful for during the holidays. See you all next year! D.C. Update S. 3825 - Designating the United States Post Office, located at 3903 Melear Drive in Arlington, Texas, as the ""Ron Wright Post Office Building."" I filed H.R. 6626, the bill to provide for the ""Ron Wright Post Office,"" I am thankful Senator Cornyn then filed S. 3825 as the identical bill, passed it in the Senate, and it is now on signed into law. I'm also thankful for Senator Cruz cosponsoring S. 3825. Congressman Wright dedicated his life to the people of Texas. Congressman Wright was a pillar in the community that he served. We thank Ron for all that you have done for the people of Texas and for the people of the United States. We all miss Ron, and I hope that Susan, his bride, and his children and grandchildren will take a great deal of pride in the fact that this will be named after him. The National Defense Authorization Act - I voted YES on this year's NDAA. The NDAA will authorize funding to defend America and its interests. This bill contains provisions that will counter China, support Taiwan, give our servicemembers a pay raise, and increase our military capabilities. Also, the bill rescinds the COVID-19 vaccine mandate on all active and reserve component servicemembers and ends servicemember separations for failure to take the COVID-19 vaccine. I am happy the bill includes my amendment about how to help the transition from active duty to private life. The Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs will be required to report specific information to Congress so lawmakers can best evaluate what gaps exist during the active duty/private citizen transition and how to close those gaps, especially when dealing with mental health assessments. This language in the NDAA fulfills a campaign promise to help with the mental health care of our veterans. The VITAL Assessment Act - I first introduced this bill on October 8, 2021, as my first bill as your Congressman, and as the year ends, I am grateful that it is on its way to the president's desk. The VITAL Assessment Act becoming law will help our student veterans receive the mental health care that they have earned. The bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to report to Congress on the effectiveness and challenges of the VITAL program, a program with a proven record of reducing veteran suicide. Since the VITAL Assessment Act will further improve mental health services delivered to college students who are veterans, it will further reduce student veterans' risk of suicide. The passing of this bill could not have been done without Senator Cornyn's sponsorship and Senator Cruz's support. It's truly amazing what we can accomplish if we work together. District Update During this holiday season and as a new year unfolds, I am reflecting on the past couple of months and am reminded of the wonderful people in my district who have a servant's heart. In November, I had the opportunity to meet the young men and women from TX-06 who were seeking a Service Academy nomination. In reading their application essays I saw the quality and values we look for in our leaders of tomorrow. The candidates of 2023 are a remarkable group of individuals who embody the American resilience and excellence we look for in our servicemembers. We are truly in safe hands. I want to share with you a couple of excerpts that really inspired me from some of these amazing essays - Candidate Cook , ""An education through a service academy is right for me because I aspire to academically challenge myself, develop essential skills for any environment I may encounter, enhance my leadership ability, and, most importantly, gain the essential preparation to ultimately serve and protect the United States of America."" Candidate Ngyun - ""The opportunity to serve in the military would also allow me to return the favor it did for my family. My father escaped the horrors of the Vietnam war at the age of 9. His boat was stranded. However, a Naval ship appeared and saved my father's family. This incident was instilled into my father's core memory which inspired him to serve in the military. My father does play a small role in my inspiration to attend and serve in the military. However, the main reason I would like to serve is to help other families the way my family was aided. Being granted the opportunity to help others the same way my father was helped is a dream of mine. No matter the role in the military, every action contributes to the welfare of our country. Serving in the military would not only allow me to return the favor it has done for my family but ultimately serve the people that define the United States of America."" Candidate Lee - ""Additionally, it would allow me to give back to others in these communities by serving. Ultimately, I want to attend a military academy to be challenged and pushed in a way that allows me to not only serve this country but also to emerge as a leader and the most optimal version of myself. This is what I desire most to do with the next decade of my life and I know that this will be a decision I would never regret."" In meeting these students, I was acutely aware of the calling they felt to serve others at such a young age. My Service Academy interview panel is made up of myself and 10 former service academy graduates who served as warfare qualified officers in the various branches of the military. This panel and I know the wonderful opportunities and experience that awaits at a military academy, we also know what we are ultimately asking of these young men and women. In all, 22 candidates received nominations and I am confident that many will receive appointments. We serve our neighbors in so many ways. Each community had toy drives and food drives, angel trees and community free lunches. I want to give a special thanks to Waxahachie Care for inviting my staff and I to tour their facility, we were able to see the amazing work they are doing for our community firsthand. Perhaps one of my favorite parts of the visit was giving out free turkeys and trimmings to those in our community who are in need. Our team is dedicated to serving the community and will be returning to volunteer in the new year. I want to thank everyone for their service to others; whether it be to a neighbor, church missions, volunteering, or service to our country….there are countless ways we all serve each other. During this time of year, it is important that we reflect on our service to others and our community in the spirit of giving. I also want to thank the various organizations that help our neighbors not just during the holiday season but all year long. I am grateful to be a part of such an amazing community and look forward to continuing our efforts in local service this upcoming year.. Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms. 1 Peter 4:10 Walk with Jake Walk with Jake content Was the information in this newsletter helpful?

245," It is a privilege to serve the 23rd Congressional District of Texas in Congress. Each day, I work to address your concerns and protect our liberties. Please read below for some updates on my recent work representing you in Washington, D.C. and back home in TX-23. AN UPDATE ON TITLE 42 SCOTUS Issued a Temporary Hold on Ending Title 42 Title 42 has been critical in helping U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) from being completely overwhelmed at the border. I visited the Central Processing Center in El Paso where more than 4,600 migrants were being held in a facility with a maximum capacity of 1,040. Due to this overflow, thousands of migrants are either being released into the community or being housed in public buildings such as school facilities, the convention center and the airport. If Title 42 is rescinded, additional crossings will stretch border communities beyond their limits. I will keep pushing to keep this policy in place for the sake of our national security. Met With the CBP Port Director in El Paso This week, I visited the Paso del Norte Port of Entry where I met with the Port Director to discuss how canceling Title 42 would affect trade and travel at our international bridges. This border crisis is threatening our economy, not just our safety and security. CONGRATULATIONS TO GRADUATES ACROSS TX-23 Spoke at TAMU - San Antonio's Commencement Ceremony I was honored to deliver the commencement speech at Texas A&M University - San Antonio. It was rewarding to see a new generation of leaders take this step forward, and I am excited to see what they accomplish next.

246," News from Congressman Brian Mast WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE $1.7 TRILLION OMNIBUS PACKAGE   - Under Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Congress just passed a bill that would name a federal building after Speaker Nancy Pelosi. I wish I was joking, but that's just the tip of the iceberg of the ridiculous things Congress passed today. So what else was in that 4,155-page omnibus that totals $1.7 trillion? There's $410 million for border security… except it's for the border security of Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia and Oman. While the southern border is wide open, Democrats in Congress would rather send hundreds of millions of dollars abroad to secure the borders of nations in the Middle East. It appropriates another $575 million for family planning in areas where population growth threatens endangered species. They want to keep people from having children because it might ""threaten biodiversity."" Also included is $777.5 million for the State Department's Education and Cultural Exchange Programs. The program sounds nice until you realize it's the same program that paid $20,600 to a cultural center in Ecuador to ""promote diversity and inclusion"" through drag shows. This is absolutely a disgrace to our country and a slap in the face to everyone who goes to work in the morning and earns a paycheck. That's why I voted no on this absurd omnibus bill. I break down my thoughts on the bill here: WATCH NOW To learn more about my work on your behalf, please visit my website .

That's why I voted against the $1.7 TRILLION, 4,000+ page Pelosi-Schumer Spending Bill, which adds more than $1 TRILLION to America's already unsustainable $31 TRILLION national debt and will be an inflation bomb that hurts Florida families already hurting to make ends meet. Watch HERE or below to hear what's in this MASSIVE spending bill and why I voted against it. Additionally, after fighting for months to secure a vote on a stand-alone disaster aid package, I voted to pass my bill, which would deliver needed hurricane relief to families, businesses and communities in the Sunshine State. While my bill did not pass, I will continue to work with local, state and federal officials to ensure that Floridians are treated fairly and that all needed federal hurricane relief and disaster aid is deployed quickly and in a manner that best serves Floridians recovering from these storms. Read more HERE. Read more HERE. P.S. This Christmas is the perfect time to reflect on our blessings and gather with those we love. For me, that's my beautiful wife, Ann, our incredible daughters and seven wonderful grandchildren. Christmas is also a time to remember and thank all those who are away from their families this holiday season - especially our brave service members. Thank you for the honor of representing you and fighting for Florida families in the U.S. Senate! From my family to yours, Merry Christmas! Sincerely, Rick Scott United States Senator To be the first to find out about Senator Scott's actions and statements, follow him on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram , and LinkedIn. - See more of what Senator Scott has been up to this week below. Sen. Rick Scott Votes to Deliver Needed Hurricane Relief to Florida Families After fighting for months to secure a vote on a stand-alone disaster aid package, Senator Rick Scott voted to pass his bill which would deliver needed hurricane relief to families, businesses and communities in the Sunshine State. As Floridians keep fighting to recover from Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, Senator Scott's bill would ensure that needed funding is delivered independent of the massive and reckless $1.7 trillion Pelosi-Schumer Spending Bill. Importantly, Senator Scott's hurricane relief bill also made important changes based on input received from Florida growers and others in the Sunshine State that would ensure this aid is delivered in a more effective and efficient manner, helping them more quickly and fully recover. While Senator Scott's bill did not pass, he will continue his work with local, state and federal officials to ensure that Floridians are treated fairly and that all needed federal hurricane relief and disaster aid is deployed quickly and in a manner that best serves Floridians recovering from these storms. Watch Senator Scott's remarks HERE. Read more HERE. For a full list of Senator Scott's actions in preparation and in response to the 2022 Hurricane season, click HERE. - Senate Democrats Block Sen. Rick Scott's Calls for Standalone Hurricane Relief Bill As the Senate considers the massive and reckless $1.7 trillion Pelosi-Schumer Spending Bill, Senator Rick Scott continued his fight to pass disaster aid for Florida families as independently from any omnibus funding package. Instead of standing with Florida families who are fighting hard to recover from Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, Senate Democrats have for months delayed consideration of a hurricane relief package and chosen to use Floridians as pawns in exchange for approval of their reckless $1.7 TRILLION omnibus. Today, Democrats continued to hold Floridians hostage and blocked Senator Scott's request for quick passage of this needed relief. Watch Senator Scott's remarks HERE. Read More HER E . - Sen. Rick Scott Demands Answers From Biden Admin on Misreporting of 1 MILLION+ Jobs Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to Dr. William Beach, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), demanding answers following a report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showing the BLS inaccurately reported job estimates. This letter comes before Senator Scott's meeting with Commissioner Beach on this report, which is scheduled for Thursday, December 22. While the Biden administration continues to tout a successful economy, this report shows only 10,500 jobs have been added between March and June 2022-an alarming difference of more than 1,000,000 jobs. Read the full letter HERE. Read more HERE. - Sen. Rick Scott: Actions Speak Louder Than Words, Democrats Must Stop Appeasing Communist Cuban Regime Senator Rick Scott continued his calls for the oppressive, illegitimate Castro/Díaz-Canel regime to finally release the Cuban freedom activists its holding as political prisoners and subjecting to mistreatment and violence. Last week, following more than a year of urging from Senator Scott, President Joe Biden finally issued a statement calling for the immediate release of all political prisoners who have been held since the July 11th protests. Immediately after this statement was released, Senator Scott received alarming reports that José Daniel Ferrer was beaten in front of his family during their recent visit with him. Following these horrific actions by the regime's thugs, Senator Scott again reached out and spoke to Archdiocese of Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski, Organization of American States (OAS) Secretary General Luis Almagro and the United Nations (UN) Secretary General António Guterres to urge coordinated calls for the release of all political prisoners and condemnation of the Cuban regime's human rights crimes and brutal oppression. Senator Rick Scott said, ""What the oppressive, illegitimate Castro/Díaz-Canel regime is doing to the freedom-loving people of Cuba is disgusting. Yet Joe Biden and Congressional Democrats continue to give the regime the validation it wants with appeasement and gross photo ops that help it hide the brutal oppression its forcing on the Cuban people. Recently, we learned that Díaz-Canel's thugs beat freedom activists José Daniel Ferrer in front of his wife, daughter and young son. These thugs beat a husband and father in front of his family, in front of his children - and just days before, Democrat members of Congress traveled there to shake hands and smile for photos. THIS APPEASEMENT IS WEAK, DISGUSTING, ENABLING THE TORTURE OF POLITICAL PRISONERS AND IT MUST END NOW. The Biden administration must stand with us and match its words with actions and stop its weak appeasement of the illegitimate regime. The freedom-loving people of Cuba and the wrongfully imprisoned July 11th protestors depend on this. If the Biden administration truly supports a new day of freedom for Cuba, actions to support the Cuban people, like supplying internet and reinstating sanctions, must be taken to denounce this brutal action and condemn the Cuban Communist regime.""

Rick Scott & Marco Rubio's Bipartisan Restoring Resilient Reefs Act Becomes Law Senators Rick Scott, Marco Rubio, Brian Schatz and Mazie Hirono applauded the signing of their bipartisan Restoring Resilient Reefs Act into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. The legislation will reauthorize and modernize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000, strengthen the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coral Reef program, and give new and innovative tools and resources to the non-federal partners who are closest to the crisis in American coral reefs: states, territories, and local communities. The Restoring Resilient Reefs Act increases authorizations for the NOAA's Coral Reef Program from $16 million to $45 million annually. This landmark legislation also authorizes a state block grant program for $12 million annually to support state efforts to manage and restore coral reefs, and $4.5 million annually for Pacific and Atlantic coral reef cooperative institutes. Together, these provisions represent a major step forward for coral reef stewardship. Senator Rick Scott said, ""The Restoring Resilient Reefs Act is a great win for Florida's environment, and will build on our efforts to help restore and protect our coral reef ecosystems. I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Rubio, Hirono and Schatz, as well as Congressman Soto, for their hard work on this legislation and am proud that we finally got it across the finish line. I'll never stop fighting to make sure future generations can enjoy all that Florida has to offer."" Read more HERE. - Sens. Rick Scott, Marco Rubio, Colleagues to Biden: You Must Not Make Any Concessions to the Communist Cuban Regime As the Biden Administration and Democrats in Congress continue to push for concessions to the criminal dictatorship in Cuba, Senator Rick Scott joined Senators Marco Rubio and Jim Risch in sending a letter to President Joe Biden warning against a return to the United States' failed Obama-era policy of engagement with Cuba. Read More from Senator Rubio's office HERE. - Sen. Rick Scott: $1.7 Trillion Pelosi-Schumer Spending Spree is a Reckless Inflation Bomb Senator Rick Scott hosted a press conference regarding his and his colleagues' opposition to the $1.7 trillion, 4,000+ page Pelosi-Schumer omnibus spending bill that is being fast-tracked through the Senate without proper consideration. Senator Scott was joined by Senators Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Ron Johnson and Mike Braun. Earlier this month, Senators Scott and Lee wrote an op-ed for Fox News and urged the passage of a clean continuing resolution (CR) on the Senate floor to extend government funding until after the new Congress begins in 2023. Democrats blocked approval of this bill. Last month, Senator Scott joined Senators Lee, Ted Cruz and Mike Braun in writing a letter to leadership expressing the need to pass a short-term CR that funds the federal government only until shortly after the 118th Congress is sworn in. Additionally, in September, Senator Scott, along with Senators Cruz and Lee, demanded the passage of a clean CR that simply maintains current federal functions and programs until a new Congress begins in 2023, which Democrats blocked. Watch Senator Scott's remarks HERE. Read more HERE. - Democrats Block Sen. Rick Scott and Joni Ernst's Efforts to Secure the Border Senator Rick Scott spoke on the Senate floor in support of his and Senator Joni Ernst's Border's Unused Idle and Lying Dormant Inventory Transfer (BUILD IT) Act. The BUILD IT Act would require the federal government to transfer any material associated with the construction of the southern border barrier to any state, upon request, for the materials' original purpose. In January 2021, President Biden terminated construction of the southern border wall. Since President Biden's order to cease construction of the southern border barrier went into effect, the federal government began paying contractors over $3 million a day to look over unused border material, according to a report by the Minority Staff of the Government Operations and Border Management (GOBM) Subcommittee, a part of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs. It is estimated that roughly one quarter of a billion dollars in taxpayer-funded materials are sitting on our southern border, yet Democrats blocked its passage.

Rick Scott Donates 3rd & 4th Quarter Salary to the Marine Toys For Tots Foundation, Home Front Heroes and Collier County 100 Club Senator Rick Scott and Mrs. Ann Scott announced the donation of the Senator's third and fourth quarter salary to the Marine Toys for Tots Foundation, Home Front Heroes of Lee County and the Collier County 100 Club. Read more about these worthy organizations below. Since taking office as U.S. Senator, Senator Scott has donated his salary every quarter. Senator Rick Scott said, ""As 2022 comes to a close, Ann and I are proud to support three great organizations that are working to give back to their communities in more ways than one. The work of the Marine Toys for Tots Foundation has impacted thousands of families throughout the years, including my own. When I was growing up, my family struggled to make ends meet and Christmas gifts were a luxury. My family leaned on organizations like Toys for Tots to provide for us during the holiday season, and I know so many families who are in the same position right now whose prayers are answered by their support during this time. ""Ann and I are also proud to highlight the work of two incredible Florida organizations - Home Front Heroes, operated through the Lee County Sheriff's Office, and the Collier County 100 Club. These groups work to give back to our law enforcement officers, first responders, and their families, who sacrifice so much to serve and protect our communities. The brave men and women of our law enforcement truly care about the families they serve, and following Hurricane Ian, they've spent countless hours helping others recover and rebuild despite falling on hard times themselves. This holiday season, Ann and I are so grateful for the work of these organizations, their volunteers, and the Floridians and Americans across the country who are working to make a difference in the lives of others and inspiring us all to do the same.""

Lee's Title 42 Amendment, No Republican Should Support Pelosi-Schumer Spending Bill Senator Rick Scott released the following statement ahead of the Senate's vote to consider his and Senator Mike Lee's amendment to the massive and reckless $1.7 trillion Pelosi-Schumer Spending Bill that would extend Title 42 which allows for the expedited deportation of migrants who illegally cross the border. President Biden's open border policies have led to five million illegal border crossings since he took office less than two years ago. Administration officials have stated that the border crisis will only worsen following Title 42's expiration. Senator Rick Scott said, ""It's no secret that the crisis at the United States' southern border is raging out of control - and I'm afraid it's about to get a lot worse with President Biden and Washington Democrats allowing Title 42 to end. That's why Senator Mike Lee and I proposed a common sense amendment to extend Title 42, which may be the only policy standing between the current crisis on our border devolving into utter chaos and a total lack of control. The alternative amendment being offered by Democrats is woefully inadequate and continues their open border policies, prioritizing processing people who already crossed the border illegally instead of preventing illegal immigration in the first place. Some of my Republican colleagues support the omnibus, but if this massive, $1.7 trillion reckless spending bill proceeds without Senator Lee and my amendment, no Republican can justify voting for its passage. The incompetent Biden administration and Secretary Mayorkas clearly have no plan to secure the border and are happy to ignore this crisis, but our border patrol agents don't have that same luxury - they need support and resources NOW to address this crisis and protect our communities.""

Rick Scott Issues Weekly Update on Biden's Inflation Crisis As the Bureau of Economic Analysis' November Personal Consumer Expenditures (PCE) release showed prices paid by consumers for goods and services rose 5.5% over the year, Senator Rick Scott released a weekly update on his actions to address America's debt crisis and rising inflation. The PCE data released today shows how President Biden's inflation crisis, caused by his and Democrats' socialist policies and reckless government spending, like the $1.7 trillion Pelosi-Schumer Spending Bill, continues to shrink budgets for families as the prices of everyday goods continue to skyrocket.

Rick Scott in the Tampa Bay Times: Why I can't vote for a $1.7 trillion spending spree Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for the Tampa Bay Times slamming the $1.7 TRILLION Pelosi-Schumer Omnibus Spending Bill for forcing Florida families to accept billions in reckless spending in exchange for needed disaster relief. In the op-ed , Sen. Rick Scott wrote, ""In typical Washington fashion, Florida families fighting hard to recover from Hurricane Ian are being held hostage in exchange for approval of the massive and reckless $1.7 trillion spending bill. Immediately after the storm passed, I made clear that I would fight for and support a standalone disaster aid funding package to get Floridians the assistance they deserve and need to recover. To tell folks in the Sunshine State who are still picking up the pieces left by Hurricane Ian that this aid only comes as part of a 4,000+ page omnibus spending bill is sickening. I won't stand for it … America's national debt is $31 trillion and growing. When are we going to be so fed up that we decide this isn't sustainable? … Let's be clear: These spending bills aren't just our essential duties. They become huge policy and spending casseroles feeding Washington's favorite type of compromise where everyone gets everything they want. The result is more debt, more inflation and less accountability in how Congress spends your tax dollars … The truth is, at more than 4,000 pages, the spending bill has a lot of policies and funding priorities I fought for this year. It has more funding to preserve and protect Florida's Everglades, funding to support our military and, yes, disaster aid for the families and communities devastated by Hurricane Ian. I support all of these things, but I will never support the other parts of the bill that continue gross, reckless spending of taxpayer dollars. These are things like $2.3 million so the Department of Education can reach out to student loan borrowers and urge them to apply for Biden's illegal debt forgiveness program, more than 7,500 member projects, funding for Biden to continue supersizing the Internal Revenue Service with 87,000 new agents and continuation of policies that force every family to give the IRS visibility into their personal finances. I ran for Senate Republican Leader because I am sick and tired of seeing dysfunction in Washington create hard times for families in the Sunshine State … Democrats want to hold us hostage by saying that we can have hurricane relief in exchange for billions in reckless spending and hundreds of pages of radical policy. I say no … I promised you that I'd do that and I won't go back on my word."" Read the full op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times HERE. - The Western Journal: Sen.

As we approach the end of the year, and with the start of a new session of Congress on the horizon, I wanted to take this opportunity to provide you all with an update on our work over the past two years. I've had the distinct privilege of representing the people of Colorado's 2nd for two terms now, and I can say with assurance that the past two years have been both some of the most challenging and exciting since I was first elected to serve. Our state and community have faced significant obstacles, and through it all, I've been inspired by the resiliency, kindness and fortitude of the people of our great state. And just as we have in the years before, we will continue to face the challenges and triumphs of the new year stronger together.

And just as we have in the years before, we will continue to face the challenges and triumphs of the new year stronger together. Pictured Above: Rep. Neguse meeting with officials from Clear Creek County and the Town of Silverplume earlier this year. My colleagues and I worked tirelessly to secure the enactment of bills like the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and more. We fought to lower costs for American families, create better-paying jobs , and build safer communities. The provisions in these bills include the single-largest investment in climate action in this country's history, price caps on prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, and significant backing for rebuilding America's infrastructure. Also, in the 117th Congress, we continued our commitment to leading locally, listening to our communities, and working to solve problems for our district and for Colorado. As a result of this hard work, I am proud to announce that we've had 17 bills signed into law, saved over $10 million for constituents, responded to over 150,000 emails and calls, and hosted 16 town halls. Pictured Above: Rep. Neguse and Sen. Michael Bennet tour the burn scar from the NCAR Fire. Looking forward, a new Congress brings new opportunities, and I am honored to announce that I have been elected by my colleagues in the Democratic Caucus to serve in House leadership as Chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, furthering our work to put people over politics. I look forward to advancing our community's values and the issues that matter to Coloradans at the leadership table in Washington D.C. Pictured Above: Rep.

249," You don't want to miss this. Dear  , We hope you are staying warm and enjoying this wonderful holiday season! We are excited to announce Congressman Fallon's SAFER Act - a policy solution to the chaos at our southern border. Read more about his legislation below in the Pat's Perspective portion of the newsletter. ﻿ If you have any questions, or need help with a federal agency, please don't hesitate to contact one of YOUR offices both in district or in Washington. Do you approve of the Biden Administration's policies to censor free speech? Yes Select No Select Rep. Fallon's SAFER Act Millions of illegal aliens have crossed our southern border since Joe Biden took office because of his policies. This includes many who were released without even an immigration court date, and given the backlog in our immigration courts, even those with a date will not appear for years. Against this backdrop, now is the time to restore expedited removal to its original state as Congress intended. Last week, I introduced legislation to do just that. The American Safety and Fairness through Expedited Removal (SAFER) Act would provide Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) a vital tool to counter Biden's border policy crisis by reinstating expedited removal. My bill would do the following things: Rescind the rule that establishes the 100-mile-air-14-day limitation; Restrict the Department of Homeland Security from implementing any more rules with distance limitations; Require all illegal aliens - anywhere in the country - who procured admission through fraud or misrepresentation or did not obtain valid entry documents, and have been present fewer than two years, be processed through expedited removal; and Grant future administrations discretion to expand expedited removal further if circumstances call for it. As CBP braces for the end of Title 42, Congress must act to counter the disaster at our southern border. The American SAFER Act will no longer allow illegal aliens to receive a ""get out of jail free"" card from the expedited removal process. It's time to restore order at our southern border. For Texas and Liberty, Pat Fallon Member of Congress Texas 04 In Case You Missed It: Texans Feel Abandoned by this Administration's Policies Enough is enough! We're tired of the crime, cartels, the chaos, and the corruption. TWEET: See more here. Head over to our Youtube to watch more!

PACT Act Toxicity Screening Event We attended the PACT Act Toxicity Screening Event where trained medics were able to screen local veterans for toxic exposure. There were also healthcare providers onsite to enroll veterans in healthcare programs and initiate claims as a result of the screening, if necessary. Enrollment on Arrival | U.S. Customs Enrollment on Arrival (EoA) is the CBP program that allows Global Entry applicants who are conditionally approved to complete their interviews upon arrival into the United States.

250," News from Representative Steil December 23, 2022 Government Funding Bill Friend, Congress just passed a government spending bill that totals roughly 1.7 trillion. This bill spends 22% more on our government programs then we did last year. I voted against this massive legislative package that is being rushed through Congress in a lame duck session. Too many families in Wisconsin are unable to afford the things they need because of excessive spending in Washington. The high cost of living is the number one issue I hear about from Wisconsin families, yet Washington continues to increase spending. Inflation is around 7%, yet this bill will increase spending by 22%. My priority is to bring down costs and have a government that's accountable. Congress should be listening to the will of the American people and start getting costs and spending under control. Here are a few provisions included in this package that are a part of the increased spending: Smithsonian Institution : $1.144 billion in spending for the Smithsonian Institution, an increase of $82.285 million over last year. Within this amount there would be funding for the Smithsonian's 2021 Climate Change Action Plan. Washington DC Kennedy Center Theater : $45.380 million for the Center, a $4.94 million increase over last year Presidio Trust : $90 million in funding for the Presidio Trust, $50 million above last year. This is a national park right by the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco. Department of Defense Climate Change and Resiliency Project s: $95 million for climate change resilience Electric Vehicle Fleet: $16 million in new funding to transition to a fully zero emission vehicle (ZEV) Federal Fleet. Taxpayer funding for the D.C. Metro: $150 million to the D.C. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). The President did not request funding for this account. Additional Infrastructure Spending : $800 million for infrastructure investments on top of the $1.5 trillion that was passed but has not yet been spent Additional Funding for the Internal Revenue Service : $12.3 billon for the IRS on top of the $80 billion passed earlier this year This level of spending threatens our most critical programs like Social Security and Medicare. I'm focused on protecting these programs, which is another reason why I voted against this massive spending bill. We need to rein in spending in order to bring costs down and protect Social Security and Medicare. As always, if you would like to share an opinion with me on Washington's spending, please don't hesitate to reply to this email, or give one of my offices a call. I wish you and your family a very Merry Christmas and hope you all are staying safe and warm. On Wisconsin, Bryan Steil Member of Congress Click here to subscribe to my e-newsletter Washington D.C.

251," News from Representative Upton December 23, 2022 @MyKitchenTa ble: F riday December 23, 2022 Dear Friend: ""One cannot count on luck. It comes and goes. But one can count on hard work. ALSO, staying out of your OWN way… and, for most folks, that's the hardest part."" - Amey Upton THANK YOU As I reflect on more than four decades of service in the federal government - working for our former Southwest Michigan Congressman David Stockman, then President Ronald Reagan, and finally in the U.S. House of Representatives - I am so grateful for the countless folks who have helped along the way including my peers, staff, and wonderful family who have helped me do my best day after day. I was asked last week what I want to be remembered for, and without a second thought I pointed to a small, simple brass frame with a motto that I picked up from my grandfather's desk when he passed away at 96 years of age. It read, ""When in doubt, do the right thing!"" I have kept it at the center of my desk and work at the Capitol all these years. In this journey I have been blessed by the sacrifice of many. First and foremost, my wife Amey, who as my best friend for some 40 years has watched me depart practically every week for a trip to Washington D.C., making 99.9% of the nearly 22,000 votes cast. I often was at one of our district offices or community events most days of the week. I still vividly recall the Bangor town meeting on a Halloween Saturday morning in 1987 when the word came down that my wife's water had broken, and I had better get to the hospital PDQ. Then there was my son reminding me not to talk to strangers as a 6-year-old in the Watervliet 4th of July parade or having to miss my daughter's birthday to participate in a debate during one of my 25 contested elections. Obviously, the sacrifice of family time they all made was something they endured, especially last-minute schedule changes to long-planned family activities. My staff - such a blessing. Janet Zielke and Joan Hillebrands were with me all 36 years and a number of others more than 20 years. Joan actually started as a legislative correspondent and worked her way to Chief of Staff where she has been steadily guiding our ship for the last 25 years. Corey Hanson, Mitzi Fitzpatrick, and Nivia Marquis are the best in the business at solving IRS, small business, immigration, and veterans' issues among others. My communications folks handling press on local and national interests were always terrific, Caroline Banaszak and Jamal Ware helped finish up strong. Dale Shugars and Mike Ryan ran my two district offices, and I have known them both for many decades as leaders in their respective communities of Portage and St. Joseph. And before them, Al Pscholka, John Proos, Jeff Breneman, Clay McCausland, and Jack Baker held those same titles. Kaitlyn Peterson was my front desk traffic cop directing many constituent inquiries. All in all, we handled more than one million constituent inquiries. All my staff carried the same passion to do the right thing from the start. Whether it be DC staff or here at home, they effectively and proudly served so many thousands of people in our communities. Every Congressional office is different, but I established ours with my two Michigan offices handling my constituent services, and my DC staff preparing me on legislative issues. Almost everyone started as an intern, answering the phone, and hearing from constituents by answering the mail (remember, the internet didn't become widely available until the late 90s) From there, they moved up and were recognized for the experience they gained and dedication they demonstrated. My former scheduler and Officer Manager Bits Thomas started as an intern and then was my ""doorkeeper"" for a decade before she moved back to Michigan with her family. Her stellar successor, Suzanne Scruggs, once worked for a Cabinet member and is married to one of my first volunteers from 1986, who later became my Legislative Director. He later went to law school at night and now helps run one of the most prestigious firms in Washington. Alec Zender was with us several years helping our farmers and small businesses, then went to fellow Michigander Rep. Jack Bergman. Last but not least, the point man and architect who shepherded 21st Century Cures, Mark Ratner. As resident comedian and my MSU sports rival, he served as my legislative right-hand man for nearly 20 years. And the list goes on. I am so proud of our team. I've been involved with a long list of issues, so long that there has been little time to stop and ""smell the roses."" HOW IT STARTED It was the late State Senator Harry Gast who convinced me to serve on the House Transportation Committee when I was first elected so I could help complete US-31 connecting three interstates in Berrien County. There were a lot of bumps, potholes, and butterflies along the way, but I am happy to say the project is now complete. Also, my amendment in that first five-year highway bill increased Michigan's share of each federal dollar from 72 cents to 90 cents, providing billions that would have otherwise gone to other states, and later helping to widen and improve I-94 with US-131 moving east towards I-69. Moving from Transportation to the powerful Energy & Commerce Committee in 1991 I had a terrific mentor in Chairman John Dingell. I served as Chair of the Oversight, Telecommunications, & Energy Subcommittees which eventually led to me becoming Chair of the full committee from 2010-2016. Speaker Newt Gingrich changed the seniority rules making the chairs compete for the chairmanships with a six-year term limit. Without that change, I would still be sitting as a senior member of the committee but still not having had a chance to lead it. Yes, bipartisanship was always a guiding principle. I learned that at the Reagan White House where a GOP president worked with a Democrat-controlled Congress and got things done. Quite frankly, quite a few Americans probably voted with both hands to fill in ballot circles or punch the chad for him in 1980 yet we saw him win in a landslide 4 years later except for Mondale's Minnesota. I always kept one of Reagan's mottos in mind, ""It doesn't matter who gets the credit, as long as the job gets done."" PRIORITIES The Great Lakes has always been a top priority for me. I've worked to ban micro-beads, ensure water quality funds, establish an oil spill response team, pipeline safety and delivered on a plan with Governor Rick Snyder to replace Line 5 under the Mackinac Bridge at a $500 million cost. I also spent time ensuring our harbors were dredged, battling Asian Carp, and authorizing a new lock for the Soo. If the 60-year-old lock went down, it would literally double the nation's unemployment as iron ore could not make it to the steel mills for autos, appliances, and our manufacturing industries. As a vice-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solver's Caucus (PSC), we met virtually every week and were instrumental in passing the CHIPS and Infrastructure bills to help America remain competitive. We also played a role in the Paycheck Protection Plan (PPP) that enabled so many of our small businesses to keep their employees paid during the COVID shutdown and provided a lifeline to maintain their presence. On the morning of September 11, 2001, I drove through the Pentagon parking lot about an hour before the plane hit the building. General Van Antwerp, whom I had grew up with on my street in St. Joseph, was spared because he was at a meeting out of the building, but a number of his staff were killed. As the Telecommunications Subcommittee Chair, I led a number of colleagues to New York City a few days later, where the rescue mission was still taking place at Ground Zero. We later passed legislation that was a top priority noted in the 9/11 Commission's report to allocate broadcast spectrum allowing law enforcement to have their own frequency to communicate. We did so by forcing the broadcasters to convert their analog broadcast signal to digital and selling that newly created spectrum to the highest bidders in the telecommunications industry. This allowed them to produce devices with text and video, paving the way for the 5G network, hundreds of thousands of jobs, and generated revenue to reduce the deficit. Supporting our brave troops and our veterans was always the easiest vote I cast. Whether it be Agent Orange or Burn Pits benefits or visiting our troops in harm's way in Iraq or Afghanistan, visiting our military hospitals here and overseas, count me as a grateful American. Allowing our vets to receive medical care in their home community if they prefer versus traveling across the state to a VA facility was also a choice I supported. I have had the opportunity to have many classified briefings on China, Ukraine, Russia, and protecting American interests. We are a free nation because of our brave. It always has been a favorite moment for me to nominate qualified young men and women to attend our military academies. General Emery Upton was in the West Point class with George Custer and later served as Commandant. His statue is on Little Round Top in Gettysburg. And my 98-year-old dad served in World War II, including the Battle of the Bulge. HIGHLIGHT Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the enactment of 21st Century Cures the most important legislative achievement in that Congress when President Obama signed it into law in December 2016. I led a three-year effort as chair of the Energy & Commerce Committee to pass this legislation, which expedites the FDA approvals of drugs and devices and was coupled with $45 billion in additional health research funding. We literally held dozens of roundtable discussions, hearings, meetings with disease groups, the FDA, National Institutes of Health (NIH), pharmaceutical companies, and research institutions like the University of Michigan, MD Anderson, Mayo Clinic, Harvard, and the Milken Institute. Fast forward four years to COVID. Pfizer's CEO told his folks that they would spend ""whatever it takes"" to find a vaccine and thankfully were successful. Cures allowed them to produce the vaccine prior to the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and be able to deliver it across the country the very next day after receiving the EUA in December of 2020. This was probably 6-8 months earlier than would have happened without our legislation, saving hundreds of thousands American lives. Then Vice President Joe Biden played a pivotal, hands-on role, and we included the $1 billion Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot initiative as part of this bill. One of our great sources was Nobel Prize winning immunologist Jim Allison whose breakthroughs have been the answer to thousands. The terrible events of January 6 continue to dominate the news nearly two years later, including this week's release of the final committee report. That morning, I walked through the House floor back to my Rayburn office where I watched many of the protesters parading under my balcony to the White House grounds. I then watched the President's speech to the crowd on TV before they came back to the Capitol and certainly attempted to violently disrupt the counting of the electoral votes cast by each state. I saw the gallows on the Capitol lawn intended for Mike Pence, and thanked some of the SWAT team members laying exhausted in the Rotunda. Chilling. Michigan was one of the four states that was going to be challenged despite the 154,000-vote difference. To date, there is still no credible evidence that our vote was fraudulent. I voted absentee in that election, as I did this last November 8, and I am confident that our system works. Under the law established in the 1800s, it only takes one Member from the House and Senate to force the full House and Senate to reconsider. This week the House and Senate adopted a legislative change requiring a minimum of 20% of each body to challenge a states' certified count. In my estimation we avoided a massacre of my colleagues on the House floor by only 10-15 minutes. Trump's later statement that he did everything ""totally appropriate"" was a key factor for my impeachment vote a week later and my support for a bipartisan January 6 congressional commission. In my view, the commission's unanimous support for their report issued this week prevented the facts from being swept under the rug and helped ensure preservation of the peaceful transfer of presidential power. More than a thousand folks provided testimony to get the truth that otherwise never would have been told. Where were these same souls who knew the intimate story when we debated impeachment? Crickets. You can hear my NPR interview on ""All Things Considered"" HERE that I did on December 21. ONE R E GRET One regret I will share was the failure of the Super Committee a dozen years ago to deal with the deficit. It had six members of the House and Senate: six Republicans and six Democrats. The rule was that we had to get seven votes, and we could never get more than six as it turned out. We spent a couple months negotiating different alternatives but could never quite get there. I was one of the ""aye"" votes with fellow Michigan colleague and Chair of the House Ways & Means Committee Dave Camp, but we were one vote short. The looming budget deficit remains a threat that most certainly future leaders must address. ZELENSKY ADDRESSES CONGRESS My last two days in Congress were action packed. On Wednesday evening, I attended a joint session of Congress in which we heard from the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky. Earlier this year, I had a chance to listen as Zelensky addressed the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus by Zoom. It was encouraging to now see him in person as he makes the compelling case for Ukraine directly to the American people and their representatives. I have had the opportunity during my career to watch presidential national addresses and world leaders speak to the Congress such as Nelson Mandela, Queen Elizabeth, the Pope, and others from around the globe. I was especially proud to listen to President Zelensky on one of my very last days serving in the US Congress. You can read my full statement on the address HERE . OMNIBUS The House and Senate cleared a $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill to keep the government open and funded through the 2023 fiscal year. Here I am on the House floor shortly after casting my last vote as a Member of Congress. I voted for the package, funding a number of priorities, including a 10-percent increase in defense spending to $858 billion. The bill also includes $1.5 billion for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Health, that like its defense counterpart, will fund cutting-edge research that has the potential to save millions of lives. This is the next step for 21st Century Cures . The bill also includes $45 billion to help Ukraine defend its freedom and citizens against Russia's brutal invasion, including barbaric attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure. The bill passed the Senate by an overwhelming vote of 68 to 29, and later passed the House by 225 to 201. I supported Congress acting this year because it avoids the risk of a government shutdown to start the New Year, given the narrow majorities in the House and Senate. A shutdown would threaten America's security and cause disruption to vital domestic programs, including those that help improve health outcomes in our nation. It clears the deck for the next Congress to start fresh on FY '24 rather than mop up unfinished business four months into FY '23. You can read my statement on this vote HERE . With today's vote, I want to thank the people of Southwest Michigan for giving me the chance to serve as your congressman all these years. It has truly been an honor and privilege to serve. As I mentioned in my most recent Kitchen Table, I will be continuing my e-newsletter on a new platform following my exit from Congress.

253," News from Representative DeGette ABOUT DIANA SERVICES ISSUES NEWSROOM STUDENTS CONTACT ME Dear Friend, I hope you are keeping warm as our city continues to experience record cold temperatures. With dangerously low temperatures expected to continue through the weekend, officials are urging everyone to stay indoors and avoid extended periods of time outside. Local officials have also opened a 24-hour emergency warming shelter at the Denver Coliseum for those who have nowhere else to go to get out of the cold. The potentially life-threatening weather our city is now experiencing adds new urgency to our efforts to help those experiencing homelessness throughout the Denver-area. Earlier this year, I was able to secure more than $13 million to fund nearly a dozen projects aimed at helping the unhoused in our community, and I'm proud to report that several of those projects are quickly moving forward - including our effort to purchase and convert the now-vacant Stay Inn Hotel into more housing for the homeless, and the construction of a new shelter for Denver youth, which will soon break ground. As I've said many times, I believe deeply that we need an all-hands-on-deck approach to help those experiencing homelessness in our area, and we need all levels of government working together to come up with creative new solutions to address this crisis. I'm thrilled to announce that in addition to the $13 million we secured earlier this year, I have just secured an additional $24.2 million to fund 14 more projects in our area as part of the government spending bill Congress passed today. Most of these projects will be aimed directly at helping those experiencing homelessness in our community, including $4 million to help fund the construction of 74 new apartments for low-income, single-parents in Denver's Warren Village; $4 million to help fund the purchase of the now-abandoned Clarion Hotel in North Denver and convert it into more housing for those experiencing homelessness; and $1 million for Habitat for Humanity to build several new homes in Denver's Villa Park. It also includes $2.2 million for Denver Health to provide essential oral health services in some of Denver's most underserved communities; $1.2 million to help the Food Bank of the Rockies purchase additional coolers to store and distribute more food to those in need; and $1 million to help construct a new youth mental-health treatment center in North Denver to help low-income children in that area. Each of these projects is designed to provide critical support in neighborhoods that desperately need some help and to provide a critical lifeline to those in need. While none of these projects, alone, will solve the crisis we face overnight, they will go a long way to helping a lot of people in our area - and each project will play an important role in building a broader web of support to help those experiencing homelessness throughout the Denver area. Below you will find a full list of the 14 projects that will now be funded in our area: As always, if you have any questions about these or any other issue, please call my office at 303-844-4988, or visit my website at where you can learn more about all of the different ways my staff is available to assist you.

254," News from Representative Velazquez Dear    , December 2022: Congresswoman Velázquez End of the Year Update In this issue: A Note from Congresswoman Velázquez Community Funding Inflation Reduction Act Reproductive Rights Gun Violence Puerto Rico Fighting Climate Change A Note from Congresswoman Velázquez Dear Neighbor, As this year comes to an end, I would like to take this opportunity to reflect on what we have accomplished for New York's working families. Throughout this year, I've listened to your calls and read your mail, and I appreciate each one of you who took the time to make your voice heard. I have worked with my colleagues in Congress and the Biden Administration to uplift working families, protect constitutional rights, and find solutions to problems that face New Yorkers and our nation. It is time that we reflect on the tremendous progress that New York City has made and look to the future to build upon this progress. In the next Congress, I will continue to work with my colleagues to help create a more just and equitable New York City. Below you'll find updates on my latest work in Congress. As always, please contact my office with questions, concerns, or to share your opinion. Sincerely, Nydia M. Velázquez Community Funding Every year, Congress comes out with a spending bill to provide federal funding to local programs that benefit our communities. In the latest bill, Congresswoman Velazquez was able to secure millions for community initiatives and non-profits serving New York's 7th Congressional district. This money will cover everything from job training and mentorship for youth living in public housing, to ensuring culturally appropriate mental health services are available for New Yorkers, to funding tenant's rights legal programs. This money will go a long way to ensuring working family's needs are met across the city. In the most recent federal spending bill, she was able to secure funding for the following projects: $750,000 for the Acquisition of a building in the Bushwick, Brooklyn neighborhood to create the Brooklyn Center for Social Justice, Entrepreneurship and the Arts (BCSEA), $1,800,453 for the Arab-American Family Support Center in collaboration with the Academy of Medical & Public Health Services, Brooklyn, NY for immigrant mental health initiative services, including equipment, $1,025,000 for the Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy in collaboration with NYC H20 (Ridgewood/Highland Park), Greater Ridgewood Youth Council, and St. Ann's Warehouse youth education and stewardship initiative programs, $750,000 for the Fifth Avenue Committee (FAC) Barrio Affordable Solar, $1,100,000 for the Grand Street Settlement 80 Pitt Street Community Center Renovation to make capital improvements within the Community Center, $300,000 for the Loisaida, New York, NY for an environmental and community science program to promote a climate workforce development & entrepreneurship, $800,000 for the Make the Road New York, Brooklyn, NY in collaboration with Bangladeshi American Community Development & Youth Services for adult literacy programs and services, including the purchase of equipment, to improve economic outcomes, $2,000,000 for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, New York, NY to renovate an existing kitchen and office spaces, bathrooms, patient room doors, and replacement of surveillance cameras at Woodhull Mental and Medical Center in North Brooklyn, $1,000,000 for the North Brooklyn Anti-Violence Initiative in collaboration with St. Nicks Alliance, Riseboro and The Wick/Los Sures which will help to prevent violence and improve the quality-of-life in North Brooklyn with innovative strategies, $750,000 for the NYCHA ADA Accessibility and Security Lighting Project at Borinquen Plaza and Red Hook East and West, $300,000 for the Good Old Lower East Side (Goles) Public Housing Leadership Academy to train emerging leaders in Lower East Side public housing, $750,000 for Evergreen Exchange in coordination with Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation for a business assistance program Resilient Recovery: Brooklyn's Industrial Waterfront, $1,500,000 for the St. Francis College, Brooklyn, NY nursing simulation lab for the education of future nurses in coordination with The Brooklyn Hospital Center, $1,200,000 for the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg Inc., Brooklyn, NY in collaboration with Henry Street Settlement will provide social services initiative connecting families to assistance to reduce poverty and improve economic independence, $2,000,000 for the Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY for facilities and equipment to increase access to colorectal cancer screenings. Inflation Reduction Act Congresswoman Velázquez knows how tough inflation has been on working families in her district and that's why she worked with Congressional Democrats and President Biden to take major action to reduce inflation. After months of negotiations, Democrats introduced and ultimately signed into law The Inflation Reduction Act. This once in-a-generational piece of legislation will make an historic down payment on deficit reduction to fight inflation, invest in domestic energy production, and is the single biggest investment in history to fight the climate crisis. The bill will also finally Affordable Care Act program for three years through 2025. Congresswoman Velázquez was proud to support this monumental piece of legislation not only for what it will do nationally, but in her district as well. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act constituents in Congresswoman Velázquez's District will see the following benefits: - The average enrollee is expected to save $1,426 in premiums starting next year. - A family in the district with two adults, two children, and a household income of - $75,000 could save $2,832 on their premiums next year. - A household of two adults over the age of 60 with a joint income of $70,000 could save $8,868 on their premiums next year. - Medicare beneficiary in the district enrolled in a standard drug plan would have saved an estimated $250 in out-of-pocket costs. - Monthly copayments for insulin products will be capped at $35 per month for Medicare beneficiaries. For more information on the investments the Inflation Reduction Act makes, click here. Reproductive Rights Congresswoman Velázquez has always been a fierce advocate and fighter for reproductive rights and this year, was no different. In June, the radical right-wing Supreme Court overturned the landmark decision Roe v. Wade, taking away one's right to bodily autonomy. The decision resulted in fifty years of legal precedent being ignored and stripped a fundamental right away from Americans across the country. Congresswoman Velázquez would get to work fighting back against this decision. In the House, she voted in favor of the Women's Health Protection Act , which establishes a statutory right for health care providers to offer abortion services to patients. It would also prohibit states from imposing restrictions on abortion care. She also voted in support of the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act , a bill that addresses recent efforts by state legislatures to punish Americans traveling to other states for reproductive health care. The bill would ensure no person acting under state law could prevent, restrict, or otherwise retaliate against a person traveling across state lines for lawful abortion services. Congresswoman Velázquez will continue to fight for abortion rights, and she is determined to work with her Democratic colleagues to ensure that this basic right is recognized. During her time in Congress Congresswoman Velázquez has been a staunch advocate for reproductive health care for all. Unfortunately, more than 270 million people around the world have an unmet need for family planning using modern contraception , and in the United States 19 million women of reproductive age live in an area with a lack of reasonable access in their county to a health center that offers the full range of contraceptive methods. Therefore, Congresswoman Velázquez introduced a Resolution in Support of World Contraception Day that expresses support for global and domestic access to contraception and encourages Congress and the Administration to study contraceptive deserts and ways federal policy can address the issue. Gun Violence For far too long, gun violence has plagued New York's communities, causing pain and suffering for countless New Yorkers. Congresswoman Velázquez for decades has been a staunch advocate for strict gun control measures that would keep tools of war off our streets. In this year alone there was 607 mass shootings in the United States which is the second most in our nation's history. Congresswoman Velázquez and her Democratic colleagues said enough is enough. She was proud to support the Assault Weapons Ban Act of 2022 which would ban the sale, import, manufacture, or transfer of certain semiautomatic weapons, bump stock-type devices, and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices. In addition to the Assault Weapons Ban Act, Congress worked to come up with a bipartisan solution to make our communities safer. Congresswoman Velázquez was proud to vote for the Safer Communities Act which aims to combat gun violence and includes provisions that will improve access to mental health care and help equip schools with the resources necessary to keep schools safe. The Safer Communities Act was signed into law over the summer , but Congresswoman Velázquez knows there is still more that needs to be done to keep tools of war out of our communities. In New York City, easy access to ghost gun blueprints makes these untraceable weapons more accessible to bad actors and more likely to show up in our neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces. Congresswoman Velázquez signed onto a letter calling on President Biden to undo a Trump-era rule that weakened export controls designed to prevent computer files for the 3D-printing of firearms from being available on the internet and ending up in the wrong hands. Congresswoman Velázquez will continue to work in Congress to ensure tools of war are kept out of our communities. Puerto Rico As systemic inequities continue to affect Puerto Ricans on the Island, the Congresswoman has remained a strong and vocal advocate for the people of Puerto Rico. For decades, solving the Puerto Rican colonial conundrum has been at a standstill. However, after months of negotiations, the Congresswoman came into an agreement on a way forward to decolonize Puerto Rico called the Puerto Rico Status Act . This proposal was crafted after public input from the people of Puerto Rico and is a bill that will finally give the people ability to decide their political future. This crucial piece of legislation was recently passed by the House in an historic vote for the people of Puerto Rico. As one of the negotiators of the bill Congresswoman Velázquez was proud to support this legislation which was a monumental step forward for the people of Puerto Rico. During the debate on this bill Congresswoman Velázquez gave a speech in support of the Puerto Rico Status Act. You can watch her full speech here. As Puerto Rico was getting ready to remember the 5th anniversary of Hurricane Maria , Puerto Ricans had to prepare for the threat of Hurricane Fiona. Due to insufficient action to fix the issues lingering from Hurricane Maria, the island was left vulnerable to Hurricane Fiona. In the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona, Congresswoman Velázquez got to work in assisting the island in its road to recovery. She led a letter to Congressional leadership requesting Congress pass an emergency funding bill to support Puerto Rico's response to Hurricane Fiona that includes $1 billion for the Nutrition Assistance Program. Congresswoman Velázquez also urged President Biden to issue a Major Disaster Declaration for all of Puerto Rico's municipalities in response to Hurricane Fiona. Congresswoman Velázquez introduced a bipartisan piece of legislation that required the Department of Homeland Security to waive the Jones Act for vessels that provided disaster relief to Puerto Rico. Fighting Climate Change Congresswoman Velázquez has been a fierce advocate for new and innovative ways to fight the growing consequences of climate change. This summer, Congresswoman Velázquez led ten Members of Congress in sending a letter to the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to urge the department to phase out agricultural pesticides on National Wildlife Refuges through a rulemaking process. In the past, pesticides were heavily relied upon and seen as a panacea to agricultural challenges. This is not the case any longer; increasing scientific awareness of the real risks to ecosystems from pesticides means this tool no longer serves its intended purpose. Earlier this year Congress passed the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law which made an historic investment in new ways to build green infrastructure. Congresswoman Velázquez was proud to announce that New York received $257,806,980 to provide New Yorkers with additional green transportation options, ease congestion in local communities and reduce carbon pollution across the state. This grant not only benefited the climate, but it will also help to reduce America's reliance on foreign energy and protect working families from rising costs. During the negotiations of a government funding bill, Senator Joe Manchin attempted to sneak in detrimental permitting changes on oil pipelines. Congresswoman Velázquez was proud to stand with her colleagues in sending a letter to leadership to not include the dirty permitting deal in the government funding bill. These provisions would've significantly and disproportionately impact low-income communities, Indigenous communities, and communities of color. With the end of 2022 marking the end of the 117th Congress, Congresswoman Velázquez was able to get a lot accomplished for the people of New York's Seventh District. Below you can see some of the ways the Congresswoman served through constituents her offices has aided, bills she has supported, and federal funds that she has brought to her district.

256," An Honor and A Privilege This year, while we have weathered much: drought and wildfire, supply chain shortages, economic hardships, and more, we have also witnessed the very best of humanity in our district. Neighbors came together to support each other. We stood up strong for our beliefs and our way of life. And most importantly, we reopened our businesses and put people back to work. As we near the end of 2022, I want to take a moment to look back on some of the work I've done in Congress for our district. From passing landmark legislation to securing critical funds for projects in our communities, we've accomplished a lot. I am so proud to call Central Washington home, and I look forward to the work we will continue to accomplish in the next Congress, together. Below is my 2022 End of Year Report.

This week, it was my official honor and great personal privilege to welcome President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine to the United States Capitol, where he delivered an inspiring message of unity, courage and determination to a Joint Meeting of Congress. In the face of Putin's horrific atrocities, Ukrainian freedom fighters have inspired the world with an iron will and an unbreakable spirit - repelling Russia's brutal, unjustified invasion. In defending their Democracy, they are fighting for Democracy everywhere. In December of 1941, my father had the privilege of attending Sir Winston Churchill's address to Congress, where he called upon America to help fight tyranny in Europe, telling his allies: ""We are doing the noblest work in the world - not only defending our hearths and homes, but the cause of freedom in every land."" More than eight decades later, the United States is proud to stand with Ukraine as it fights for that same righteous cause. Following President Zelenskyy's visit, the Democratic Congress proudly passed another round of vital security, economic and humanitarian aid for the Ukrainian people - building on President Biden's plans to deliver life-saving air defense systems. Our nation will continue working to isolate Russia and support Ukraine until victory is won. As Putin escalates his appalling atrocities against civilians, we will continually reaffirm this truth: Russia's unlawful occupation of all Ukrainian territory must end, and Russia must be held accountable for its crimes. Keeping Government Open and Working For The People Today, the Democratic Congress passed bicameral, bipartisan government funding legislation for Fiscal Year 2023. Thanks to Democrats' tenacious negotiating, we secured an enormous increase in non-defense discretionary funding - investing heavily in families and workers, honoring our commitment to our veterans and strengthening Democracy at home and abroad. This legislative package: Expands quality, affordable health care by preventing disruptions to families' coverage, while strengthening critical lifelines for underserved communities Ensures permanent, mandatory and continuous coverage for the 40 million children enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP Invests in veterans' health care, delivers a pay raise for our heroic troops and expands support for our military families Enacts the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to crack down on workplace discrimination, safeguard Americans' economic security and uphold dignity on the job Advances justice for Americans impacted by terrorism with the Fairness for 9/11 Families Act Delivers emergency disaster support to help hurricane and wildfire victims, address the water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, and strengthen Puerto Rico's electrical grid. Secures Community Project Funding to help meet the specific needs of families and communities here in San Francisco Reforms the Electoral Count Act to thwart future assaults on our Democracy Defending Democracy This week, the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack concluded eighteen months of tireless work in defense of American Democracy. The Select Committee has been relentless in their pursuit of the truth, painstakingly documenting the sinister plot to subvert the Congress, shred the Constitution and halt the peaceful transfer of power. The Select Committee's findings are essential to ensuring that such an attack never again threatens our Republic. Our Founders made clear that, in the United States of America, no one is above the law. This bedrock principle remains unequivocally true, and justice must be done. Free At-Home COVID-19 Tests Free at-home COVID-19 tests are now available at for order and shipment through the United States Postal Service. Each household can order one set of four individual rapid antigen COVID-19 tests. An order number will be provided after order entry, and a tracking number sent upon shipment.

258," About Contact Services December 23, 2022 Dear  , Today I helped pass a government funding package with key New Hampshire priorities that I secured including reducing energy costs, fighting fentanyl trafficking, supporting public safety, improving veteran care, and investing in our workforce. Before the weekend starts, here's a few New Hampshire priorities that I fought to be included in this package: Securing Funding for Community-Driven Projects I secured funding through our community-driven process for 15 common-sense, local projects that will support our first responders and law enforcement, strengthen our manufacturing and skilled workforce, invest in our infrastructure, and help New Hampshire families and children. I worked closely with community leaders across the First District to deliver this funding for local priorities, and I look forward to seeing the wide range of benefits from economic growth to improving public safety. Support For Veterans Three of my bipartisan veterans' bills were included in this package. The VA Beneficiary Debt Collection Improvement Act will improve VA's debt collection process and protect veterans from undue financial strain. The VA Supply Chain Resiliency Act will strengthen VA supply chains and ensure our veterans receive the best possible medical care. The Improving VA Accountability to Prevent Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Act will improve policies and oversight of how VA addresses systemic issues of sexual harassment and discrimination. The inclusion of these bills help fulfill our promise to ensure that our veterans receive the highest level of care and service. Measures to Combat Drug Trafficking Bipartisan legislation that I introduced alongside Congressman Newhouse extended emergency measures to address trafficking of fentanyl analogues through December 31, 2024 was also included in the package. This legislation will ensure that law enforcement retains the tools they need to seize fentanyl-related substances and combat drug trafficking. I'll continue to work across the aisle and alongside law enforcement and public safety experts to keep our families and communities safe. Stay up to date and follow along on Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram . I hope your holidays are filled with joy and rest, and spent with loved ones. Travel safe and take care.

261," Dear Friends, As we celebrate the glorious day of the birth of our Savior Jesus Christ, I want to wish you and your family the merriest of Christmases! I hope you experience the joy of Christmas, the peace of Christmas, and the hope of Christmas! It's a special time of year. As we gather with family and friends around the Christmas tree to share gifts and make memories, I hope we also remember the 'Reason for the Season'-the time God became a man being born in a stable in Bethlehem to make a way for us to have a personal relationship with God. It was the most monumental moment in the history of the universe! ""Emmanuel-God with us!"" The angel announced the good news of his arrival to the shepherds tending their flocks that night: ""Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord."" A heavenly host appeared with the angel saying: ""Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."" It is Good News! ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him."" The truth I have come to appreciate more and more is: He didn't come just to save us from our sins, he also came that we might have life-abundant life. There is a prophecy about Jesus found in Isaiah 61:1-4 that sheds light on all the reasons Jesus came and what that can mean for all of us. Jesus read these verses (Luke 4:18-19) and told the crowd they had been fulfilled in their hearing. ""The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on me, because the Lord has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn, and provide for those who grieve in Zion- to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair."" That is indeed Good News! How many of us have been brokenhearted or captive to sins/addictions or oppressed by darkness or desperate for comfort or in need of knowing that God loves us? How many times have we sensed the 'spirit of despair' and needed relief, freedom, gladness? I would think most of us could relate to many of these challenges. I am thankful I came to know Jesus when I was nine years old. Even though I hadn't done anything the world would consider 'really bad', I was selfish and running my own life. My prayers were telling God what to do and treating Him like a benefactor who would due my bidding. Basically, I was a sinner and separated from God like the Bible says we all are. ""For we all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."" (Romans 3:23) I was saying my prayers one night before bed telling God, as usual, to do this or that and thanking Him for loving me when I realized for the first time, I had never told God I loved Him. I felt such a flood of remorse and, through tears, told God I was sorry and that I loved Him, too. I shuffled down the hall in my pajamas to talk to my folks about what was going on. My mom was gone to a church meeting, but my dad was sitting in his easy chair reading the Successful Farming magazine like he did every night. He invited me to sit beside him and asked me to share what was going on. I did and he asked if I thought I had been telling God what to do rather than asking what He wanted me to do. I said, ""Uh huh"". He asked if I felt bad about that and wanted Jesus to be Lord of my life (rather than me selfishly running my own life). I nodded and said, ""Uh huh"". He explained how doing things against what God wants us to do is called 'sin' and is harmful to us, but we can ask God to forgive us and to turn around and do things differently with His help. I said I wanted to do that. He said I could just talk to him right then and tell him. I did. I said a simple prayer asking God to forgive me and asking Him to be Lord of my life. From that moment on, Jesus has been my Best Friend, my Lord, my Savior. He has been with me through life's many ups and downs. He never leaves me nor forsakes me. He has been true to his promises outlined in Isaiah 61 and I am so grateful for that. I am thankful for Him coming to earth at Christmastime and for the Heavenly Father loving us so much as to make a way for us to be children of God. I hope you know Him, too. If you do not, you can pray a simple prayer like I did, and accept the best Christmas gift ever-the gift of Jesus Christ and His salvation. ""For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."" (Romans 6:23) Merry Christmas to all!

262," Click here to view this email in your browser Dear Dr.  , Merry Christmas to you and your loved ones from Audrey, Bobby, Elizabeth, and me. It's been a privilege to represent Connecticut's Second District in Congress throughout 2022, and I hope your holiday season is filled with peace and joy. Now, a few updates from a busy week in Congress and eastern Connecticut. Community Project Funding Secured for Eastern CT & more in the 2023 Budget This week, Congress passed the FY23 omnibus, a bipartisan spending package that ensures the federal government will remain open for business through September 30, 2023. I'm excited to say the package we voted to pass includes funding for a wide range of eastern Connecticut priorities that I worked to secure - including $21.5 million for 15 Community Projects spread across the Second District. These projects are complimented by 12 others from the Senate. Take a look at where the projects are in the district and learn more about each one of them here. Click here to learn more about the 15 Community Projects Rep. Courtney secured funding for in the FY23 omnibus I worked side-by-side with our towns and community partners to secure federal funding for these important projects, which they otherwise wouldn't have been able to afford-from improved childcare services, to new affordable housing opportunities, to infrastructure upgrades that will support our fishing industry on the shoreline and protect our environment while preparing for growth in northcentral Connecticut. We worked hard to win support for these initiatives. It took tough sledding to get this budget finally completed, but at the end of the 2023 budget package is one that targets support straight to some of our most important local priorities. That's great news for eastern Connecticut, and these are just a few examples of how the Omnibus benefits our region-there's a lot more! The 2023 budget also includes another substantial increase for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). In Connecticut, LIHEAP is the primary funding source for the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program (CEAP), which provides direct support to seniors and families to help keep energy costs low. With winter here, I continue to hear from people who are facing down high home energy costs, and CEAP is providing eligible homeowners with the assistance they need to offset those costs and keep their homes heated. I was proud to help lead the effort to increase LIHEAP funding this winter. The 2023 budget also includes new support for our farmers who have been impacted by drought, serious investments in workforce development and skills-training programs, new support for our veterans, servicemembers, and their families, and funding to help protect our natural heritage and environment here in eastern Connecticut-including new funding to help move spent nuclear fuel out of our towns and into longer-term interim storage sites so that we can start increasing nuclear energy production. For more on the eastern Connecticut priorities and initiatives that received funding in the 2023 budget, click here. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Addresses Congress On Thursday evening, we had the honor of welcoming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the House of Representatives for a moving address to Congress. His address was an impassioned reminder of what's at stake as his county continues its defense of democracy and sovereignty in the face of Russia's disgusting aggression, and he posed not just a political question, but a moral one of whether the West will stay resolute in support of Ukraine's defense of democracy and the rule of law. On Wednesday, Rep. Courtney joined his colleagues in the House and the Senate for an address by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy President Zelenskyy didn't mince words-Ukraine is winning this fight for democracy against an aggressive, lawless Russian state, and that wouldn't be possible without the supplies and munitions America has provided. His address was a strong reminder of the importance of our continued support, and the appropriations package we passed today includes a new round of military and humanitarian assistance for our allies. Specifically, the budget includes funding to ensure the continued delivery of equipment, defense articles, training, and supplies that have proved critical to Ukraine's success, and it takes steps to ensure that we're conducting thorough oversight of all of it. The omnibus also provides support to humanitarian initiatives for Internally Displaced Persons within Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees. I'm glad Congress answered the question posed by President Zelenskyy's address with full-thoughted support for our allies and the defense of democracy. Visiting Spent Nuclear Fuel St orage Sites with the Assistant U.S. Secretary for Nuclear Energy We need an ""all of the above"" approach to expanding domestic energy production and lowering costs-that includes nuclear energy. On Tuesday, Assistant U.S. for Nuclear Energy Dr. Kathryn Huff and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Dr. Kimberly Petry joined me for visits to the Dominion Millstone Nuclear Power Plant in Waterford and the former CT Yankee Nuclear Power Plant at Haddam Neck for in-person inspections of these facilities, where they currently have large quantities of spent nuclear fuel rods stored. That material was never meant to be stored there for the long-term, and if we're going to ramp-up nuclear production, we need new interim storage sites for these rods. Using federal funding that I've voted to supply in 2021, 2022, and now again in 2023, the Department of Energy has begun a consent-based process to identify new interim storage sites. The ball is really rolling on this effort, and I invited Dr. Huff and Dr. Petry to come to southeastern CT for a firsthand look at the work the teams at Millstone and Yankee to safety store this spent fuel. On Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Secretary for Nuclear Energy Dr. Kathryn Huff and Deputy Assistant Sectary for Nuclear Energy Dr. Kimberly Petry joined Rep. Courtney for visits to Dominion Millstone Nuclear Power Station in Waterford and the former Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant in Haddam Neck for an in-person inspection of the storage of spent nuclear fuel Dr. Huff and Dr. Petry also joined me for a community forum where they provided an encouraging update on the Department of Energy's program and reiterated that it is critical to solve this issue if our nation is going to achieve a zero-carbon emission future. Just after our visits to Waterford and Haddam Neck, I helped pass the omnibus which provides $53 million for nuclear water management and directs the Department of Energy to move forward with its process to identify interim storage sites. The process will take some time, but DoE has already received positive feedback from numerous interested communities in other parts of the county to facilitate an interim site. I keep in close touch with CT Yankee and Millstone and continue to work in bipartisan fashion as a member of the Spent Nuclear Fuel Solutions Caucus. Thank you to both Dr. Huff and Dr. Petry for joining me this week and for an update on their important work for a clean energy future. I look forward to new developments on the Department of Energy's consent-based process in 2023.

The school was recently awarded a five year $287k/year federal grant to support its student Veterans in their academic careers. The grant comes from the Department of Education's Veterans Upward Bound program - which is designed to motivate and assist Veterans in achieving success when pursuing degrees from college and universities. Veterans have sacrifices so much in service to our nation, and we owe them a solid academic launching pad. That's what this grant funding will provide for UConn's student Veterans. Thank you to UConn's Director of Veterans Affairs and Military Programs Alyssa Kelleher for updating me on how the school will put these federal funds to use. On Monday, Rep. Courtney visited UConn's Office of Veterans Affairs and Military Programs for an update on how the school will use the Veterans Upward Bound grant funding from the Department of Education While at UConn, I also received a briefing from Lt. Col Seth Allen and Lt Col Ryan White on the school's Army and Air Force ROTC programs. UConn's ROTC programs have some of the highest enrollment rates in the country!

263," From the Office of Rep. Joe Morelle December 23, 2022Dear    ,Over the past year, I've had the opportunity to meet with countless organizations and individuals in our community, listen to your concerns, and take them back to Washington. Your comments have guided my work and led me to take action on meaningful legislation that impacts families across every corner of our community, and in doing so, I truly believe we are making Rochester a better place for everyone who calls it home. One of my top priorities in Congress has long been to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, because I've heard from too many families about the extreme measures they are taking to afford their prescriptions. That's why I'm so proud that this year, my colleagues and I passed legislation to lower the cost of insulin to $35 a month for seniors on Medicare, create an annual cap on out-of-pocket costs, and finally give Medicare the authority to negotiate down the prices of prescription drugs. This will save families-especially older members of our community-thousands of dollars a year. Other highlights of the year included passing legislation to expand life-saving healthcare services for our veterans through the Honoring Our PACT Act, supporting regional innovation and America's competitiveness on the world stage with the CHIPS and Science Act, and protecting the fundamental right to marry whomever you love by passing the Respect for Marriage 2022 is coming to a close, my work on behalf of you and your family remains steadfast.

The spread of these images can cause irrevocable emotional, financial, and reputational harm. Unfortunately, women are often disproportionately impacted, and until now, little has been done to provide them with protection or recourse from this disturbing phenomenon.

Soon our West Ashley office will be relocating to Mount Pleasant - our phone number is also staying the same. Our new office location is 652 Coleman Blvd, Mount Pleasant, SC 29464 Tuesday we were given the 4,155-page Omnibus spending bill - the same week just days before we are forced to vote on the package. How are we supposed to read a 4,155 page spending bill, which will add $1.7T to our national debt, within days? It's impossible. Wednesday was a big win - our Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act with Rep. Ro Khanna was signed into law by President Biden. To strengthen our cybersecurity is to strengthen our national security. Last week, we sent a bipartisan letter with Rep. Mikie Sherrill to Congressional leadership to bring the Equal Pay for Team USA to the House Floor for a vote after passing the Senate. Late Wednesday it passed and we leveled the playing field! Wednesday was also the start of the Winter Season. Our weather here in the Lowcountry is expected to be the coldest in years - make sure to bundle up. Goose Creek is offering warming shelters starting today through Sunday. Look here for more information. On Friday, we voted NO on the $1.7T Omnibus spending bill.

The final funding package also includes $28,682,064 in Community Project Funding for 15 community projects across the 28th Congressional District of Texas.

268," News from Representative Wild The week-in-news in a single, snack-sized bite. DECEMBER 19 - DECEMBER 23 Hi all, Susan here! Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and Happy Kwanzaa! I wish you all a wonderful holiday and hope you rest and revel in family and friends. To anyone who will be traveling over the weekend, I'm wishing you safe travels and an easy journey. For those remaining in the Greater Lehigh Valley, may your home be warm, merry, and bright. It is the greatest honor to serve as your representative in Congress. Today, I voted to pass the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 to fund our government, lower costs for families, and advance Pennsylvania's economy. This government funding bill reflects priorities I have long worked to advance -lowering health care costs, keeping our promises to seniors and veterans, investing in education and job training, and addressing the unique needs of our community. I am proud that this bipartisan, bicameral bill includes funding for my Regional Innovation Hubs legislation and 15 Community Project Funding requests , supports law enforcement and our military, and invests in the VA, Social Security Administration, and Internal Revenue Service to ensure American taxpayers receive their benefits and refunds in a timely manner. I was humbled to sit in a joint session of Congress to hear Ukrainian President Zelenskyy speak Wednesday night. One quote of his stood out to me: ""We stand, we fight, and we will win because we are united: Ukraine, America, and the entire free world. "" We are certainly united, and I'm reminded of that any time I speak to members of our region's Ukrainian-American community, which is one of the largest in the United States. Our support for Ukraine will not waver until its fight for freedom is won. 1. Rep. Wild Secures Funding for Local Community Projects ""I am so proud to deliver $18 million for local projects across the Greater Lehigh Valley, made possible by a government funding bill that reflects priorities I have long worked to advance for the people of Pennsylvania's Seventh District,"" said Rep. Wild . ""The 15 Community Project Funding grants are a reflection of strong local-federal partnerships and are a testament to the importance of listening to the unique needs of our community. I am eager to see these funds at work."" Read more here. 2. Rep. Wild Announces Winner of 2022 Congressional App Challenge ""I'm continually blown away by the passion and talent behind the apps submitted to our Congressional App Challenge,"" said Rep. Wild. ""Technological innovations are the solution to many of our world's most pressing issues - and the young leaders who possess the skills to design, execute, and operate these inventions hold the keys to our nation's to the future. I am especially impressed with the goals behind this year's winning app, RecycleBot: improve sustainability and reduce our individual carbon footprints. As we respond to the collective call to protect our shared environment, RecycleBot's offers a practical solution to waste management challenges. Congratulations to Tushar Mehta of Parkland High School for earning this recognition and thank you to all the students who shared their work with my office."" Read more here. 3.

269," December 19-23 Dear Friends, It is my greatest honor to represent you in Congress. As always, my mission is to advocate for Upstate New York and the North Country's priorities at the highest levels of government. Here is a look at my past week working for you in Congress. A Christmas Message It has been my highest honor to represent New York's 21st District at the highest levels in Congress this year, and I look forward to continuing to deliver results for Upstate New York and North Country families in the new year. As we take time to gather with friends and family to reflect on our many blessings this Christmas, I hope you'll join me in thanking the incredible people that make up the fabric of our communities. This holiday season, my thoughts are with the brave men and women who serve our country to keep us safe, especially those who may be spending their Christmas away from their families. I am thankful for our 10th Mountain Division soldiers, our veterans across Upstate New York and the North Country, and our military families. Thank you for your sacrifice. Merry Christmas to our first responders who keep our communities healthy and safe. You so often answer the call to help day or night, and I know your selfless work does not stop just for the holidays. ﻿ To our farmers and producers that provide our communities with nutritious and delicious products, thank you for your hard work! From my family to yours, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! My Work This Week for Upstate New York and the North Country Calling Out CDC Censorship of Defensive Gun Use Data Following a private meeting between the CDC and gun control activists, the CDC caved to the Far Left anti-gun agenda and removed a CDC-commissioned study regarding defensive gun use from the CDC website. In response, I called on the CDC to immediately end their blatant politicization of the facts in pursuit of the Far Left anti-gun agenda. The Biden Administration is shamefully lying to the American people and hiding the facts of how law-abiding citizens use their Constitutionally-protected Second Amendment rights to keep our families and communities safe. The American people deserve the truth, not more partisan action from the CDC. I will continue to provide a critical check on Joe Biden and hold Democrats accountable for attacking the Constitutional rights of Americans. Read my full letter here. Rejecting Lame Duck Democrats' Nearly $2 Trillion Wish List I rejected Lame Duck Democrats' Far Left wish list that spends nearly two trillion taxpayer dollars to expand their radical agenda. One-party Democrat rule has failed hardworking Americans. Due to Democrats' reckless spending and failed policies, every family is experiencing the most expensive Christmas in history, our southern border is in chaos, and energy costs are skyrocketing. Instead of addressing these crises, Lame Duck Democrats doubled down on their radical wish list that spends nearly two trillion taxpayer dollars to expand their radical agenda. In the midst of the historic border crisis of their own making, Democrats are failing to provide necessary support for our brave border patrol, but are working to subsidize illegal immigration by providing $10 million for lawyers for illegal immigrants. While families are struggling, Democrats are pushing over $12 billion for the IRS to target the middle-class. They have proven their priorities are not for hardworking Americans. The American people have seen through Democrats' out-of-touch priorities, which is why they put an end to one-party Democrat rule. Make no mistake, in the new majority, House Republicans will rein in reckless spending, secure our border, and provide a critical check on Democrats' radical policies on behalf of hardworking families. My full statement. Advocating for our Dairy Farmers Following my continued advocacy, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is taking further action to address Canada's breach of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) agreement and ensure proper access to the Canadian market for Upstate New York dairy farmers. After Canada breached its commitments under USMCA by unfairly administering dairy tariff-rate quotas in a way that harms American dairy farmers, I have been calling for action. The USTR is responding to my calls and filing a new request for dispute settlement consultations with Canada in order to expand the scope to include additional elements necessary to ensure that Canada fully complies with its USMCA obligations. Our dairy farmers work hard to provide delicious and nutritious products for our communities and deserve the expanded market access they were promised as part of USMCA. I will continue to work to ensure Canada fully abides by its dairy market access commitments, and I will continue to advocate for results for Upstate dairy farmers. Read about my advocacy here. Calling for Tax Burden to be Lifted from New York National Guardsmen I joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues in calling on President Biden and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to formally designate Kenya a combat zone to allow a group of New York National Guardsmen stationed in the region to receive Combat Zone Tax Exclusions. The history and dedication of the 1st Battalion 69th Infantry Regiment are a huge source of pride for New Yorkers. As these National Guard soldiers deploy to Djibouti, Somalia, and Kenya, they deserve not only our appreciation, but every single benefit they earned. It is shameful that the Biden Administration is preventing our soldiers from receiving Combat Zone Tax Exclusions while they are bravely serving in Kenya, which has experienced several terrorist attacks. I'm proud to stand up for our National Guard Soldiers by calling on the Biden Administration to formally designate Kenya a combat zone to ensure our servicemembers are eligible for the benefits they deserve. Learn more here. My Statement on Lame Duck Pelosi's Sham Unconstitutional Jan 6th Committee House Democrats and Vicious Never Trumpers, who were run out of Congress by the American people, continue to desperately and unconstitutionally target President Trump and Republicans. The American people see through this partisan charade, which is why they fired Nancy Pelosi once and for all. House Republicans are committed to the truth. This week, House Republicans released a 140 page report that outlines Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats' many failures to secure the U.S. Capitol on January 6th and their politically motivated partisan committee. This confirms everything we've known for the last two years about Speaker Pelosi's abysmal failure to secure the U.S. Capitol. The facts are clear, Pelosi and House Democrat leadership were more worried about 'optics' than securing our nation's Capitol. Pelosi's illegitimate committee was never about seeking the truth. In fact, the only member of Congress that was off limits from these investigations was Nancy Pelosi, who failed to secure the Capitol. In the new Majority, House Republicans will demand accountability for Pelosi's complete failure to secure the Capitol and their partisan sham investigations against their political opponents.

270," A Joyful Season Trimming the tree. Wrapping the gifts. Making Christmas cookies. We cherish these traditions with our loved ones. And then on Christmas Day, the flurry of preparation gives way to the warmth of the fire, the aroma of a delicious dinner, and the sounds of family and friends gathered together. All this and more make Christmas a special time to be thankful for the blessings of family and for God's love revealed through His son, Jesus. Like many South Dakotans, my most treasured Christmas memories are tied to family traditions. I remember piling in the car for Christmas Eve at my grandmother's house for her Norwegian specialties, lutefisk and lefse. We would then continue on to Okaton for the annual Christmas Eve service. During Christmas, my siblings and I always looked forward to a break from school, ice skating with friends, and sledding down Jackson Avenue in Murdo, hopefully on a new, faster sled that had arrived under the tree. As Kimberley and I raised our daughters, we kept many of our families' traditions alive - although we replaced lutefisk with clam chowder, a family favorite. I'll always cherish the memory of watching my daughters in their church and school Christmas programs and joining in their excitement on Christmas morning. Now that our daughters have grown up, our family has grown to include our two sons-in-law and five grandchildren. We've started new traditions, but we still share Christmas Eve together like we did with my grandmother all those years ago. As I spend time with my family during the holidays, I'm also mindful that many of our servicemen and women stationed around the globe don't get to spend Christmas with their families. I'm grateful for the freedoms we enjoy as Americans, our South Dakota way of life, and that we are able to celebrate Christmas in peace and security. These things aren't free, and at Christmastime I'm especially thankful for our men and women in uniform and their families, whose sacrifices and bravery help secure these blessings. The Christmas season also brings out some of the best in our communities. I am always impressed with the generosity of the many South Dakotans who give their time and resources to help the less fortunate during the Christmas season. Their giving spirit represents the best of South Dakota and the best of the holiday season. Whether it's the bright decorations, the aroma of a tree and a delicious meal in your home, seasonal songs on the radio, or the good cheer emanating from family and friends, it's easy to get into the Christmas spirit in South Dakota. As you celebrate your families' traditions and make new memories this holiday season, Kimberley and I want to wish you a blessed Christmas and much happiness in the New Year. May the season be filled with joy for you and your family. All the best, This is an unattended mailbox, but if you would like to submit a comment or concern, please email me here or call my office at 202-224-2321.

272," The latest from Congressman Cicilline --> Dear  , This week, Congress passed the 2023 federal spending bill and it is now on its way to the President's desk. For 2023, every Member of the House was allowed to submit 15 projects to the Appropriations Committee for inclusion in the spending package. I am proud to report that all 15 projects that I advocated for were included in the final legislation. These 15 projects will help Rhode Island families with childcare and affordable housing, with the development and expansion of community centers, allow for better fire protection, and help us develop a safer, cleaner, and more efficient water supply. This funding will also support our community's mental health and bolster learning opportunities for our students. You can read more about all these projects here . Also included in the package is the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022. This bipartisan legislation will enable an historic investment in our nation's antitrust enforcement while saving taxpayer money. It is a victory for working Americans and small businesses, and will make a real difference in ensuring that our economy works for everyone. This legislation was part of the suite of bills introduced following the Antitrust Subcommittee's 16-month, top-to-bottom investigation into the state of competition in digital markets, and was the cornerstone of the Judiciary Committee's markup in June 2021 of a bipartisan suite of bills to restore competition online. Additionally, by passing this bill, we also provided additional aid for Ukraine and delivered on our promise to protect our free and fair elections with the Electoral Count Reform Act. Updates from Rhode Island $2M to Boost Local Vaccination Efforts Eight Rhode Island community health centers are set to receive $2,086,664 from a new U.S. Department of Health and Human Services program meant to increase vaccination rates for COVID-19 in underserved populations. Community health centers are a key resource for Rhode Island's underserved communities and this funding will help ensure that all of our neighbors have access to and knowledge about COVID-19 booster vaccines. As we contend with an increase in winter illnesses - including the flu, RSV, and COVID-19 - it's vital that every Rhode Islander has the ability to protect themselves and their loved ones. This federal funding will help to improve access to vaccines, improve outreach to vulnerable communities, and help get more shots into arms by lowering barriers to care for Rhode Islanders hardest hit by COVID-19. Community Angels' Toy Drive It was a privilege to join Community Angels' Toy Drive for another year of free toys, coats, and winter gear for children in our community. Thank you to all those who donated their time and goods to the drive! Kicking Off Hanukkah with the City of Providence It was great to kick off Hanukkah with the City of Providence and so many community organizations at the Third Annual Hanukkah Spectaculah celebration. Chag Sameach to all those celebrating! Updates from Washington, D.C. Welcoming Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to Congress It was an honor and privilege to hear from President Zelenskyy Wednesday night as we held a Joint Session of Congress to mark his wartime visit to Washington. Ukraine's battle against Russia's illegal and barbaric invasion is not just a fight for the preservation of territorial integrity, it is one for democracy and against autocracy. As President Zelenskyy said, our aid to Ukraine is not charity, it is an investment in democracy and a free world. We, and our partners around the world, must continue to stand with the Ukrainian people. The Justice for Victims of War Crimes Act Following Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's joint address to Congress Wednesday evening, the House of Representatives voted yesterday to update war crimes law to ensure that alleged war criminals cannot find safe harbor in the United States. Passed by a unanimous vote in the House and Senate, the Justice for Victims of War Crimes Act (S.4240/H.R.7818) will update current war crimes statute to enable prosecution of war criminals in the United States regardless of the location or targets of their atrocities. The bill also eliminates the statute of limitations for certain war crimes. I introduced this bill with Congresswoman Victoria Spartz (R-IN-05) and Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Dick Durbin (D-IL),   Graham (R-SC), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) to stop the United States from being a safe haven for war criminals seeking to avoid accountability. With this legislation, we will ensure that any person present in the United States, regardless of nationality, can be brought to justice for their brutal, unwarranted, and illegal human rights violations committed under the guise of war. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation finally negates the 'get out of jail free card' that has existed in our judicial system for far too long. Final Report from the January 6th Committee This week, the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol released its final report and held its final public hearing. The report and public testimony make clear that former President Trump and his team systematically planned for the events of January 6th. This attack on democracy and his desperate attempt to illegally hold onto power was unquestionably an insurrection. The evidence is overwhelming and there must be accountability. You can read the Committee's final report here and find additional materials from the Committee on its website here . Free COVID Tests Via the Postal Service The Biden Administration announced yesterday that households can once again order free at-home COVID-19 tests though the Postal Service this winter. You can order your tests at or by calling 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489). Health Insurance Open Enrollment Are you uninsured or hoping to pay less or change your health insurance plan? Rhode Islanders can shop for your 2023 plan NOW, through January 1, 2023 at . Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, 13 million Americans will save an average of $800 individually or $2,400 per family per year on their health insurance premiums. Key Dates: Sign up by December 23, 2022 for coverage beginning on January 1, 2023 Sign up by December 31, 2022 for coverage that will be active starting in January 2023 The last day for Open Enrollment is January 31, 2023 for coverage that will become active in February 2023 Help with Winter Heating and Utility Costs As winter approaches, it's predicted that we are going to see a higher-than-usual increase in home heating costs. To help keep these and other utility costs down, I want to share with you some resources and programs that are available through our federal, local, and state government. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps eligible low-income households pay their heating bills through federal grants to the household. There are two components to this program: Heating Assistance and Crisis Assistance. The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) helps income-eligible households reduce heating bills by providing whole house energy efficiency services to households that qualify for LIHEAP. Some services available include installing insulation and providing health and safety measures including: installing smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, reducing drafts, and providing proper ventilation. The Low Income Household Water Assistance Program (LIHWAP) , funded by the American Rescue Plan Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, is available for eligible low-income households through September 30, 2023, or until funds are exhausted. LIHWAP helps eligible low-income households afford and maintain access to drinking water and wastewater services through federal grants. One-time payments are made directly to the household's utility company. The Heating System Repair and Replacement Program (HSRRP) provides a one-time service to eligible homeowners to increase the efficiency of their heating system, or replace it if necessary. Households that qualify for LIHEAP may be eligible. As always, if you need help navigating or accesses these resources, or have questions about other resources that may be available to you, my staff and I are here to help. You can call us at (401) 729-5600 or email me at @ . Missing Your Tax Refund? If you are owed a tax refund, filed on paper more than six months ago, and the Where's My Refund? tool does not have any information about the status of the return, the IRS is now advising that you resubmit your tax return for 2021, electronically if possible. They have advised that this submission must include an original signature and all the documents submitted with your original return. More information is available here and of course, my office is always available to help. You can call us at (401) 729-5600 or email me at @ . Uniting for Ukraine: Welcoming Refugees On April 21, as part of fulfilling President Biden's commitment to welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced the United for Ukraine program. This program will enable Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members who are outside the United States to come to the United States and stay temporarily in a two-year period of parole. To qualify for the program, Ukrainians must have a supporter in the United States. These supporters are responsible for providing their Ukrainian sponsors with financial support throughout their time in the United States. You can learn more about the program, and becoming a sponsor, here . Important Passport & Travel Reminder As more Rhode Islanders and people around the world get vaccinated and boosted, we are seeing an increase in both domestic and international travel. With travel resuming, many folks are looking to renew passports and this uptick in requests has led to a backlog at the State Department. Turnaround time, according to the State Department, for expedited processing is now at 3-5 weeks and regular processing is taking 6-9 weeks from submission to receipt. Before booking international travel, please remember to check the expiration date on your passport and plan accordingly. Passports last for 5 or 10 years, depending on your age when the passport was issued. Some countries require that your passport be valid at least six months beyond the dates of your trip. Some airlines will not allow you to board if this requirement is not met. You can learn more from the State Department here . As always, I am here to serve you. If there is anything I can do, please call my office at 729-5600 or send me an email at @ . Wishing you and your loved ones a very happy holidays. Warm regards, David N.

These Community Project Funding dollars directly respond to some of the most pressing needs here in Northeast Pennsylvania by creating jobs with better pay, making us safer, and strengthening our local communities. As a senior member of the powerful House Committee on Appropriations and C hairman of its Commerce, Justice and Science Subcommittee, I proudly rank Number One in Pennsylvania and among the Top Ten in the country for securing federal tax dollars for our district. For a full list of Community Project Funding amounts coming home to NEPA, click here . Police Training Grant Announced Last week, I also announced another $250,000 in federal funds are coming back to our region to support Lackawanna County's efforts to train 600 police officers in de-escalation techniques. The De-escalation and Crisis Intervention Collaboration Project, a cooperative effort between Lackawanna County and the Advocacy Alliance, will provide strategies and tactics to law enforcement professionals on how to reduce the use of deadly force when responding to mental health and addiction-related calls. The grant funding will also provide officers with the resources and skills to manage their own emotional demands of the job. I'm always proud to fight for funding that provides area law enforcement the tools, training and resources they need to keep themselves and our communities safe.

274," Major Funding for Middlesex and Monmouth Counties Dear Neighbors,I'm writing this week with an important update on what the federal spending bill means for New Jersey residents in Middlesex and Monmouth Counties. I secured $51.3 million in the bill Congress passed this week for 15 projects in my district to help rebuild and repair infrastructure, support public health and educational facilities, invest in scientific research, and improve coastal projects include:$2.1 million to repair deteriorating bulkhead in Atlantic Highlands that is one of the most critical pieces of infrastructure for residents and businesses near the public marina.$500,000 for the Boys and Girls Clubs of Monmouth County to support school-aged children who have experienced trauma and abuse in their homes. $6 million to help build the Ferry Terminal Building in Carteret that will run from Central New Jersey to downtown Manhattan. $1.25 million for the restoration of the Church of the Presidents in Long Branch.$640,000 to educate entrepreneurs from underserved communities in Central New Jersey at Monmouth University. $500,000 to complete the final phase of an extensive restoration project at the Metlar-Bodine House Museum Historic Site, including construction of the Forever the 4th gallery that will feature the Ross Hall Wall and other important historic treasures. $2.5 million for coastal resiliency projects in the communities around Naval Weapons Station Earle. $2.25 million for Old Bridge to construct a new multipurpose building along the Laurence Harbor beachfront that will help the community expand recreational opportunities for residents. $1 million for Middlesex College to enhance student support to improve retention and increase graduation rates for adult learners and improve the lives of Middlesex County residents who have been incarcerated or at greater risk of being incarcerated. $26 million to dredge both the entrance of the Shrewsbury and Navesink Rivers at Sandy Hook as well as the Navesink River to Red Bank and the Shrewsbury River as far as the Branchport Avenue Bridge in Long Branch - a total of approximately 14 miles.$2.25 million to create a waterfront park in South Amboy by reclaiming and rehabilitating the waterfront area to create an open park concept and conservation area.$370,725 to modernize the emergency operations center in South Plainfield with new equipment and upgrades. The Communications and 9-1-1 Center is used to coordinate police, fire, and EMS services during emergencies.$3 million to renovate and expand the Dr. William Toth Health Center in Edison to better meet the health needs of the community, especially seniors.$1.5 million for Perth Amboy to complete improvements and construct multipurpose fields at the Veterans Memorial Youth League Complex Park.$1.5 million to purchase new electric buses and charging infrastructure in Woodbridge, creating cleaner air and more transportation options. Relief for Superstorm Sandy VictimsThe federal spending bill also includes an indefinite postponement of recoupment efforts for debt owed to the federal government related to Superstorm Sandy. These recoupment efforts known as ""clawbacks"" have blindsided homeowners because many New Jersey residents applied for loans and benefits offered by various federal programs at the recommendation of the government. The reprieve provides relief for approximately 1,700 households in New Jersey that owe $73 million. I will continue fighting for total forgiveness so residents can have the peace of mind they deserve.

Depending on the time it takes to complete the Elberon project, the Army Corps may also exercise an option to place 300,000 cubic yards of sand from Takanassee Lake north to Cedar Avenue in the West End section of Long Branch. There is also an additional option in Monmouth Beach that includes 1 million cubic yards from Central Road south to Valentine Street. Coastal restoration projects like beach replenishment ensure that our beaches and infrastructure remain resilient after bad weather events and will make sure they remain safe and enjoyable for residents and tourists for years to come.

It is my honor to serve you, and my office is always available to share information with you about the important issues we cover daily. Happy Holidays! Wishing you all a blessed and Merry Christmas! We have much to be grateful for this holiday season as we celebrate the close of another year with friends and family.

Opposing Democrats' Omnibus Wish List Over the last two years, Democrats have been on a reckless spending spree, culminating in this massive spending bill pushed through Congress just days before Christmas. Democrats have already forced billions of dollars through this year in their so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which, instead of providing relief for the American people, has spent billions of dollars on Green New Deal initiatives, socialist bailouts, and a lengthy progressive wish list. This last minute 4,000-plus-page omnibus offers more of the same. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am committed to being a good steward of taxpayer dollars and ensuring federal spending reflects our nation's priorities. That is why I urged my Republican colleagues in the Senate to oppose this bill, and voted against this measure in the House . Next Congress, House Republicans will be able to develop a plan to cut wasteful spending and reduce inflation, while prioritizing border security and our national defense. Addressing the Crisis at Our Southern Border The Biden Administration's continued effort to end Title 42 is only exacerbating the humanitarian crisis at our southern border. The Department of Homeland Security projects 14,000 migrants will cross the border every day if Title 42 is lifted. Last week, I joined Representative Tony Gonzales (TX) and 48 of my colleagues to urge DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to extend Title 42 until the Biden Administration executes a plan to stop the illegal border crossings. As we wait for the Supreme Court to rule on a case that would allow Title 42 to remain in place, I urge House leadership to take up the Migrants Protection Protocols Act so that Congress can codify the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy and give our border agents time to vet new migrants before allowing them into our country. Protecting the North Atlantic Right Whale Earlier this year, in an effort to reduce vessel collisions with North Atlantic right whales, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposed expanding the 10-knot speed limit zones in the Atlantic and extending speed restrictions to smaller vessels. While I support NOAA's focus on protecting these endangered whales, the shortsighted restrictions they proposed would negatively impact Northeast Florida's fishing economy and maritime commerce, as well as create hazards for boaters and anglers. Any new regulations must be made with the best available information and in consultation with all stakeholders. That is why I urged NOAA Administrator Richard Spinrad to work with stakeholders to find a compromise solution that both protects the right whale population and takes into account the needs of our coastal communities. Honoring American Patriots Forty-three years ago, Iranian student militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, captured 52 Americans, and held them hostage for 444 days. These Americans - including three Floridians - refused to condemn the United States despite enduring mock firing squads, beatings, solitary confinement, and starvation tactics throughout their captivity. Earlier this year, I cosponsored the Iran Hostages Congressional Gold Medal Act to bestow the highest honor granted by Congress to each of these heroes in recognition of their unwavering patriotism. I am pleased to see the Senate's companion legislation pass through Congress with bipartisan support, and I urge President Biden to swiftly sign this into law.

277," Dear Neighbor, Today, I voted against the Democrats' omnibus spending legislation. Rushing an over 4,000-page bill that spends over $1.7 trillion in taxpayer dollars in just a matter of days before Christmas - and before House Democrats lose their majority - is not a responsible way to govern. Rather than focusing on securing our border, controlling inflation, and promoting American energy dominance; t his legislation prioritizes Green New Deal funding that will only result in higher costs for gasoline and groceries. It's time to return to regular budgeting processes and pass budgets that serve the American people. Is government spending out of control?

278," News from Congressman Andy Biggs Home About The District News Contact The Week in Review Happy Friday! I hope everyone has had a great week. Read below to see what I've been working on! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. May the holiday season bring you and your loved ones peace, joy, and prosperity. Rejecting the Democrats's $2 Trillion Spending Monstrosity Yesterday, 18 Republican Senators helped the U.S. Senate pass the Democrats's $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill. This 4,000-page bill was released at 1:30 am Tuesday, leaving very little time for the Senate to analyze it before voting on Thursday. The bill is filled with expensive earmarks and spends money the U.S. government does not have. The bill will increase the federal deficit by $2.65 trillion over 10 years or $20,000 per household. It spends taxpayer money on unnecessary items such as a ""Michelle Obama Trail,"" a ""Ukraine Independence Park'' in DC, a ""Speaker Pelosi Federal Building '' in San Francisco, and millions more on woke initiatives and LGBT+ projects. Congress should have never considered this spending package. It should have waited until House Republicans officially took back the majority starting on January 3 to begin these discussions and pass a Continuing Resolution in the meantime. I voted against this legislation today. Click the screenshot below to see more of my remarks on this bill. Bogus J6 Committee Ethics Referral This week, the illegitimate January 6 Committee submitted referrals to the House Ethics Committee for myself and three of my Republican colleagues, falsely claiming involvement in the events of January 6. An eleventh-hour referral to the House Ethics Committee proves the sham January 6 Committee never truly needed our testimony. They only wanted the testimony to have the ability to edit and misconstrue our statements to further their own false narratives, as they did with so many other witnesses. This referral is their final political stunt. It's inappropriate to use the House Ethics Committee-a committee with more pressing matters to attend to-to help reach the January 6 Committee's predetermined conclusions. The January 6 Committee has defamed my name and my character, and I look forward to reviewing their documents, publishing their lies, and setting the record straight in the 118th Congress. December Tele-Town Hall Recap Earlier this week, I hosted a virtual tele-town hall with several thousand constituents. I provided updates on the Democrats's nearly-$2 trillion omnibus spending bill, the House Speaker's race, Biden's ongoing border crisis, and much more. I'd like to thank all who joined me. It is always a pleasure to hear from you all and respond to your insightful questions. As I mentioned on the call, this was the last tele-town hall of this year, and the last with our current district boundaries. The results of redistricting take effect on January 3. I'm so grateful for the opportunity to have represented you all in Congress, and I look forward to getting to know the new constituents of the Fighting Fifth District in 2023. Check out the responses from my poll questions below. 1) Has inflation negatively affected your shopping this holiday season? Yes (86%). No (12%). Unsure (2%). 2) Has Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy done enough for the Republican Party to earn the House Speakership? Yes (7%). No (79%). Unsure (14%). 3) Should the House investigate Dr. Fauci and the CDC's guidance related to COVID in the 118th Congress? Yes (90%). No (8%). Unsure (2%). Click the image below to see a recap of the town hall. Outlining the Collusion Between the DOJ/FBI and Big Tech On Monday, I led a panel at TurningPoint USA's AmericaFest in Phoenix regarding the Department of Justice, FBI, and Big Tech's collusion against conservatives. This group suppressed the Hunter Biden laptop story, promoted the Russian collusion hoax, silenced conservative commentators, censored differing COVID opinions, and much more. These actions won't be forgotten in the 118th Congress. The leaders of these groups should be held accountable by the House Judiciary and Oversight and Reform Committees as well as by withholding their pay using the Holman Rule. Click the image below to watch some of my remarks. Ensuring Immigration Parole is Not Being Abused for the Mass Release of Illegal Aliens This week, I sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas regarding the Department's abuse of immigration parole. Secretary Mayorkas's Department of Homeland Security is failing to provide Congress with accurate and timely information. The Department's failure to provide a report that satisfies the statutory requirement is proof that the Department is either willfully abusing its parole authority or is incompetent and does not have these records. Secretary Mayorkas testified under oath that parole is 'judged on an individualized case-by-case basis' but I have seen no evidence to support this claim. In its initial report to Congress, the Department conveniently omitted U.S. Customs and Border Protection's grant of parole to hundreds of thousands of aliens. To me, that signifies that the Department is abusing parole to allow mass releases of illegal aliens into the country. That cannot be happening. The Washington Examiner covered my letter here . Taxpayer Advocate Service Event in Gilbert On Tuesday, the Taxpayer Advocate Service attended an event organized by my office to provide on-site assistance for constituents in the Fifth Congressional District. They helped ensure that constituents are being treated fairly and understand their rights. We look forward to doing more of these events in the future! Letters and Legislation Bills cosponsored H.R. 9575 -To prohibit any employee or contractor of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the Department of Health and Human Services from transporting any alien across state lines for the purpose of procuring an abortion for such alien. Letters cosigned Letter to Senate Republicans urging them to use every tool available to kill the $1.7 trillion omnibus. My America First Contract House Republicans will need to immediately reverse the Democrats's disastrous policies to get our country back in good shape come January. My America First Contract is an outline to reduce inflation and strengthen the economy, secure our border, restore transparency and parental choice in education, reduce violent crime and preserve the rule of law, restore election integrity, break up Big Tech, put America First in foreign, energy, and trade policies, and reinstate good government practices. In addition to achieving these eight goals, the plan calls on conducting enhanced oversight and using available leverages to stop the abuse of power from President Biden in 2023. I will introduce legislation supporting each area of the plan within the first 100 days of the next Congressional term and will work with my colleagues to bring that legislation up for consideration in the House. The full contract may be read here . Alien Invasion Border Documentary I recently released my new border documentary titled Alien Invasion . The 30-minute documentary features footage from private ranches along the border, the Darien Gap in Panama, and interviews with members of Congress, Border Patrol, local and state law enforcement, and much more. It addresses how President Biden's border crisis began, its consequences, and solutions to address the crisis. The border documentary may be watched here .

279," What does the government funding package mean for NH? December 23, 2022 Hello Friends, I hope you and your family stay safe as this storm sweeps across the country, sending strong winds and weather to New Hampshire. This week, Congress passed comprehensive legislation to fund the government for the next year. December 23, 2022 Hello Friends, I hope you and your family stay safe as this storm sweeps across the country, sending strong winds and weather to New Hampshire. This week, Congress passed comprehensive legislation to fund the government for the next year. I will always fight for New Hampshire's priorities. The spending package included critical wins for New Hampshire that I was proud to advocate for - this special edition newsletter is dedicated to highlighting what the government spending bill means for our state! Expanding Access to Addiction and Mental Health Care We must continue working to expand access to alternative treatments for opioid pain relief. The government funding package included multiple measures I pushed for as chair of the Bipartisan Addiction and Mental Health Task Force to expand access to treatment and support those on the road to recovery. I was proud to lead the charge on including the NO PAIN Act, legislation to incentivize non-opioid pain management in surgical settings to address opioid addiction before it begins. I will continue pushing for better health care access in New Hampshire and across the country. Also included in this package is the Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act . From medication-assisted treatment to recovery support programs, this legislation is a major breakthrough in our efforts to address the addiction and mental health crisis. I was proud to advocate for its inclusion in the funding package and look forward to the positive impact it will have on communities across the country. Addressing Sexual Violence and Supporting Survivors Survivors of domestic and sexual abuse deal with enough roadblocks as they recover - we must continue working to support them. The funding package also included expanded resources to support survivors of sexual or domestic violence. We delivered $10,000,000 for the Violence Against Women Act Health state partnership initiative, which works to improve access to recovery services for abuse and assault. In addition, the legislation takes steps to expand access to safe housing options for survivors as they transition away from their abusers and recover. This will support not only the survivor but also their loved ones and families. Lifting Up Working Moms By expanding accommodations for working mothers in the workforce, we invest in the future of our country and strengthen our economy. Employers should not be able to take advantage of or discriminate against pregnant workers or working moms. And, thanks to this government funding package, we are one step closer to making that a reality. The package included two critical provisions to protect workers: The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, to ensure reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers and prohibit discrimination. The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act, to guarantee workers the right to breaks to pump during the work day. Investing in Our Communities No family in New Hampshire should have to choose between heating their home or putting food on the table. It has been one of my top priorities in Congress to expand access to heating assistance and ensure no Granite Stater is stuck in the cold this winter. I was proud to help deliver $4 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which provides financial assistance for families struggling to afford to heat their homes. This is a $200 million increase from the previous year. Access to quality, high-speed broadband is key for families, students, and small businesses across New Hampshire to thrive. New Hampshire communities need access to broadband services to compete in the 21st-Century economy and stay connected. The government funding package includes $455 million for expanding Broadband service, including significant investments in distance-learning and telemedicine services in rural areas. I will continue pushing to expand access to high-speed internet across New Hampshire. Funding for Projects To Strengthen Our Communities By investing in our communities and towns, we make our state stronger. The government funding package also included funding for targeted projects from throughout New Hampshire's Second District. From expanding access to affordable housing to ensuring our emergency services are modernized and ready to respond, these projects will bring positive change to our state and will make a real difference for families across New Hampshire. Our communities and our state are made stronger when we invest in the people and the places we call home. I was proud to advocate for these community projects and am thrilled to see them be funded through this spending package. Other Critical Measures Thank you to President Zelenskyy for coming to Washington and for his continued commitment to defending democracy. Photo from CNN . This week, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy delivered a message of patriotism, purpose, and hope. And, the funding package included critical investments to protect democracy at home and abroad. Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine has shown the importance and urgency of defending democracy across the globe. I am proud to stand with the people of Ukraine and support their efforts as they fight to defend their country and freedom. Finally, the package also included the Electoral Count Reform Act, legislation to ensure electoral college votes in presidential elections are tallied by Congress to accurately reflect each state's vote for President and inhibit any future efforts to unfairly overturn elections like the January 6th insurrection. We must continue pushing for accountability for that day and take steps to ensure nothing like it can ever happen again.

I also understand that this can be a difficult time of year for some, especially those who have lost a loved one. I wish peace and comfort for anyone grieving a loss during the holidays. As we head into the new year, I've been reflecting on the progress we've made and the work that still needs to be done to make our country a better place for everyone. Congress has passed-and President Biden has signed-the biggest climate bill in our history, the most comprehensive bill to prevent gun violence in 20 years, a historic bill to invest in research and semiconductor manufacturing, and a bill that will protect interracial and same-sex marriage . Unfortunately, the Senate has failed to act on several pieces of legislation the House passed, including bills to enshrine the right to reproductive health care, reinstate the assault weapons ban, protect LGBTQ+ individuals from employment discrimination, restore and expand the Voting Rights Act, and give Dreamers a long-term path to citizenship. These are some of the priorities I will continue to advocate for, regardless of who holds a majority in Congress. Celebrating the Respect for Marriage Act I proudly helped pass the Respect for Marriage Act, and it was an honor to attend the signing of this important law. When I was serving in the state legislature in 2007, I helped pass the Oregon Family Fairness Act to give same-sex couples many of the rights afforded to married couples. But we knew then that full equality means that everyone in every state has the right to marry who they love. And our work continued . In 2015, a year after a federal judge found that Oregon's ban on same-sex marriages violated the Oregon Constitution, the United States Supreme Court held in Obergefell that all people have the right to marry who they love. Congress must continue to pass legislation to protect our hard-won freedoms and privacy, especially with the willingness of this extremist Supreme Court to erode longstanding precedent. Our Solving the Climate Crisis 2022 Report In 2020, after more than a year of hearings, roundtable discussions, and feedback from Oregonians and people across the country, the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis released our Climate Action Plan . Last week we released a new report from our committee that highlights our key climate actions and accomplishments . As of today, more than 300 of our 715 policy recommendations have been adopted into rule or signed into law. Our bold, comprehensive, science-based plan for climate action created a roadmap for our country to reach net-zero emissions no later than 2050 and net-negative thereafter. With the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act, we are on the path to reduce our emissions by 40 percent in 2030. The climate crisis is a reality , and we are living under a greater threat of wildfire, drought, flooding, sea level rise, and more frequent and intense extreme weather events. By acting now to dramatically cut emissions and build resilience, we can save lives and our planet. There is still more to do to reach our climate goals, but the progress we've made under this Congress and the Biden Administration shows that it can be done. You can read ""Solving the Climate Crisis 2022: Key Accomplishments and Additional Opportunities"" here . Securing Investments for Our Communities I am thrilled to report that NW Oregon communities will receive more than $35 million for 15 projects I recommended for funding. The funding will go toward much needed road safety improvements in the Beaverton Downtown Loop , on Hall Boulevard in Tigard, and on the Newberg Dundee Bypass in Yamhill County. It will also support projects that expand affordable housing, support our local economy, improve equity in our health care system, and more. These projects were included in the end-of-year funding bill, along with several other important provisions I led to protect retirement savings , help students access meals in the summer, and fund child care. I look forward to seeing how the funding from this legislation helps our communities thrive, and am committed to continuing work on these critical issues.

281," Friend, Christmas is truly the most wonderful time of the year. It is an opportunity to spend time with our loved ones and reflect on what really matters: our faith, our families, and our communities. While there have been many challenges in our lives over the past year, I am continually inspired by Iowans' resilience, strength, and grace. This Christmas, I am blessed to have time with Matt, Max, Jax, and Bandit - we'll be staying safe and warm from the winter storms, watching our favorite Christmas movies, and putting out milk and cookies for Santa! Isaiah 6:9: ""For a child is born to us, a son is given to us. The government will rest on his shoulders. And he will be called: Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace."" I am wishing you and your families a very merry Christmas and a blessed holiday season. Read on for an update on the final legislative week of the year! Best, Omni-bust: Why I Voted No Today, Congress voted on a nearly $2 trillion omnibus spending bill - it was full of wasteful spending during this time of record inflation, and failed to secure our border during the worst border crisis in modern history. I voted no. On the wasteful spending front, this bill includes $2.3 million to advertise President Joe Biden's student loan cancellation scheme, $575 million for ""family planning"" in areas where ""population growth threatens biodiversity,"" and hundreds of millions of dollars for gender equity programs at home and abroad. These are not appropriate or acceptable uses of taxpayer dollars. Iowans remain concerned and frustrated about the worsening crisis at our Southern Border - they want Congress, and the Administration, to act. I was very disappointed that this legislation failed to address the crisis at our border. In fact, it undermines immigration enforcement and will further incentivize illegal immigration. Read more about the worst border provisions in the legislation here. We must restore fiscal responsibility and secure our border. The incoming House Republican majority will do both. The Rightful End of Proxy Voting 215 Members of Congress are ""proxy voting"" this week - proxy voting is when a Member signs a document saying they can't vote in person because of the ""ongoing public health emergency."" Then, another Member of Congress votes on their behalf on the House floor. The COVID-19 health emergency is over and Americans across this country have long been back to work. Those that represent them should be too. It's unacceptable that over 200 of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, aren't here in person to vote on the nearly $2 trillion omnibus bill - which I voted against on the House Floor. ﻿ I get it. Of course folks want to be home with their family for Christmas, and wanted to get out of here before flights were canceled because of the storm. I'd love to be with my family right now, but Iowans entrusted me to be their voice in Washington, and they didn't have me voting from Cedar Rapids in mind when they did so. I have never voted by proxy nor have I proxy voted for another Member on the House floor. Proxy voting has been abused by Members of both parties. It's bad for the country and for the institution and I'm glad it will be coming to an end in January. All Around IA-01 Clarity Clinic The team at Clarity Clinic in Dubuque is doing inspiring work to help expecting moms and new parents in the community. They provide loving support for children, moms, and dads alike. It was great to see their efforts firsthand this week and we are so lucky to have them as a force for good right here in Dubuque. Love INC of the Cedar Valley I joined the Love INC team at their open house in Cedar Falls this week. They do fantastic work to lift people out of poverty in the Cedar Valley. I'm excited to see what the new year will bring for their team and all those they support in the community. Service Academy Nominations One of the best parts of this job is calling young Iowans to give them the good news they've been nominated to one of our nation's service academies!

282," Dear Friend, I'm proud to share that this week, I voted to pass robust appropriations legislation to support New Mexico families, empower New Mexico's recovery from the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire, invest in the cutting-edge research at Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories, and support our military bases at White Sands Missile Range, and Cannon, Holloman and Kirtland Air Force Bases. The appropriations bill now heads to the House of Representatives for consideration, and will soon reach President Biden's desk. You can learn more about provisions that I secured for New Mexicans here. I also joined Senator Martin Heinrich to announce that we secured over $273 million for 146 projects across New Mexico. This critical funding will uplift New Mexico communities by restoring and maintaining our acequias, expanding access to affordable housing, modernizing transportation, creating opportunities for our kids, and strengthening health care. You can learn more here about projects in your community. Since being elected to Congress to represent New Mexicans, providing robust constituent services has always been a top priority. This year, my office secured $4.5 million in savings for constituents and assisted over 1,100 New Mexicans through casework services. As always, please reach out to my office if I can ever be of assistance. I was honored to sit down the Washington Post to discuss how Senate Democrats are delivering for Americans - from climate action to reducing costs for families - and what can learned from the recent victories in New Mexico . Read the piece here or below: Washington Post: New Mexico Democrats push their state as a model for winning in Southwest New Mexico Sen. Ben Ray Luján's confidence that his state can serve as a model for Democrats hoping to turn the Southwest into a party stronghold starts with his family. His father, Ben, grew up in a Republican family but become a prominent Democratic politician because he felt the party best served the state's and his community's needs. Luján's Republican uncle was a harder sell and didn't vote for him during his first two campaign's for Congress in 2008 and 2010. But in 2012, the year Luján's father died, Luján said his uncle decided it was time to support his nephew and his agenda. Since that time Democrats' fortunes in New Mexico have continued to get better. Now Luján and other party leaders there are speaking out more about their belief that the state can serve as a model for how the party can strengthen its hand in other Southwestern states by continuing to make deep investments in Latino voters, running Latino candidates and putting up a fight in traditionally more conservative districts. ""I'm very proud of the work that was done a few decades back where there was organizing from Hispanic Democratic candidates,"" Luján said. Democrats have hoped to make the Southwest, or the Sun Belt, a source of reliable support for the past two decades as the political map has shifted with Midwestern states becoming more competitive and Florida becoming increasingly Republican in recent elections . The population of the region is exploding, with transplants from all over the country, including Colorado and New York. The Hispanic population has also grown in the Southwest, with Democrats winning over this expanding voting bloc early on while trying to beat back Republican gains in recent elections. But through all that change in the Southwest, New Mexico has changed the least and remained, mostly, reliably blue. Both of its senators are Democrats and its Democratic governor just won reelection. In the next Congress, all three of its House members will be Democrats. There are 45 Democrats in the state House, compared with 25 Republicans, and there are 27 Democrats in the state Senate, compared with 15 Republicans. ""New Mexico is a harbinger"" for the rest of the Southwest, said Matt A. Barreto, president of BSP Research, a Democratic pollster advising the White House and campaigns on reaching Latino voters, adding that Colorado is close behind, followed by Nevada and then Arizona. Luján, who rose through the ranks of the House to assistant speaker before he was elected to the Senate in 2020, said that New Mexico turned blue after years of work by Democrats to peel off rural voters. Democrats ""showed up in places that Republicans usually don't have to worry about showing up,"" Luján said in an interview. ""It's how I was raised. It's how dad did it. It was part of our strategy when we were successful before - you need to go talk to folks."" Republicans argue Democrats are overhyping their advantage and that the state remains a competitive battleground, despite the GOP's lack of success in recent elections, pointing, in particular, to the state's 2nd Congressional District. ""I absolutely believe that New Mexico is on the path to turning red, the same as Louisiana, Arkansas,"" said Stevan Pearce, a former congressman and the head of the New Mexico Republican Party. ""These are long, slow, generational-type pulls."" A blue state without traditional liberal attributes New Mexico, a border state, is vast in its makeup. It's largely rural and includes oil and gas drilling in the eastern part of the state near Texas. It includes three national security research labs and 26 federally recognized tribes. Liberals reside in the cities, such as Santa Fe and Albuquerque. It is also the third poorest state in the country. It's population growth is one of the slowest in the country but it continues to have the largest percentage of Hispanic residents, making up nearly 48 percent in the state, according to the 2020 census . Having a stable voter bloc is a big advantage politically, too. The rapid growth of states such as Arizona and Nevada mean that campaigns have to continually introduce candidates to voters. New Mexico's demographics don't match traditional liberal strongholds, such as Massachusetts or California, but nearly a dozen analysts and political officials interviewed for this story said Democrats' success there is multifaceted and rests on the importance of the profile of the candidates as well as consistent voter outreach outside of campaign season. ""The political ideology is less important than the candidates' efforts to reach out to the community,"" Barreto said. Luján is the type of candidate who fits well in a center-left state, his allies said. He's unabashed in his support for abortion access in a post-Roe v. Wade era, but in his first two years in the Senate, he has worked with Republicans to pass numerous bills focused on New Mexico, including research and development for the national labs, assistance for communities affected by wildfires and a tax credit for carbon capture to help combat climate change. Luján suffered a stroke earlier this year , which took him away from the Senate for five weeks, but has since recovered with a full work schedule. He's from the rural northern part of the state and still lives on a small family farm in Nambé. New Mexico boasts generations of Hispanics, some of whose families have been there since before it became a state in 1912. Luján became the first Hispanic to represent New Mexico in the Senate in 45 years, and the fourth overall, when he defeated his Republican challenger, Mark Ronchetti, in 2020 51.7 percent to 45.6 percent. The first Hispanic senator, Octaviano Ambrosio Larrazolo , a Republican, was elected in 1928. The second was Dennis Chavez, a Democrat, who Luján said he tries to emulate, a sign that his goal is moving into Democratic leadership. Chavez was the fourth ranking Democrat when he died in office in 1962. Latinos make up a large share of voters in New Mexico - more than 3 in 10 voters in both 2018 and 2022 were Latino, according to AP VoteCast voter polls. Democrats contend their support among Hispanic voters has been key to their success in the state as well as other Southwest battlegrounds in the midterms . They point to key Senate wins in Arizona by Sen. Mark Kelly (D) and Nevada by Catherine Cortez Masto (D) as well as some House victories as evidence they have maintained the support of Hispanic communities despite Republican predictions ahead of the election that these voters were moving quickly into their camp. But the numbers in recent elections also raise some potential warning signs for the party about the strength of that support, mirroring the nationwide trend. For instance, in 2018 Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) won the gubernatorial race with support from 71 percent of Latino voters, according to AP VoteCast. In her successful reelection bid in 2022, she won 66 percent of the Latino vote. Similar drops occurred in gubernatorial races in Arizona, Colorado and Nevada during the same time period. But the loss of Latino support was less than anticipated and less than in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) picked up 11 percentage points among Latino voters between 2018 and 2022. Florida Latinos are mostly Cuban and Puerto Rican. In New Mexico, they are multigenerational Mexican. ""The Mexican American has been a Democratic firewall for the Democrats,"" Barreto said. Pearce - who represented the 2nd Congressional District from 2003 until 2019, except for one term because he ran and lost his Senate race - said the party is making inroads in registering Hispanic voters in New Mexico. He said an increasing number of Hispanics are running as Republicans, which he says is ""very important because politics is about visibility."" Case in point: Susana Martinez, the Republican governor from 2011 to 2019. Even Democrats argue Martinez is a playbook for GOP success. But Democrats also portray her success as unique to her as opposed to emblematic of Republican strength in the state overall. Martinez was able to ""break through the ranks and able to appeal to a wider range of voters,"" said state House Rep. Javier Martínez, a Democrat in the running to be the next speaker of the state House. ""Their nominees have been candidates that do not relate to large enough numbers of voters."" New Mexico Democrats have done well in integrating Latinos politically, according to political operatives and analysts who follow the state. It has more Latinos elected to office than any other state and campaigns are not only bilingual but bicultural. Fifty-seven percent of state House Democrats are Hispanic. Three out of five members of its Congressional delegation are. ""We know it has an impact not just on vote choice but on Hispanic turnout,"" Gabriel Sanchez, professor of political science at the University of New Mexico, said of Hispanic integration in the state. ""That's what's made New Mexico a stronghold for Democratic politics in the Southwest."" In his second term as Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair for the 2018 election cycle, Luján helped to recruit Xochitl Torres Small to run in New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District, one of the most competitive seats in the country and a seat that has been held predominantly by Republicans since 1968. Torres Small won. She was the first Latina to represent the district, in which 55 percent of voters are Hispanic. She said she ran because she didn't feel represented. ""I didn't feel like the challenges of living on the border were really seen,"" she said. Torres Small was defeated by Republican Yvette Herrell in 2020. In 2022, the candidates, party campaigns and outside groups spent about $25 million on the race, according to OpenSecrets. Herrell was defeated by Gabe Vasquez, a young Hispanic American who grew up on the border and was a member of the Las Cruces city council. But Republicans blame the legislature for the loss, saying it created a district much more hospitable to Democrats in redistricting. Democrats argue Republican candidates also struggled during the midterms because they were too extreme for New Mexico and too eager to back former president Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. ""I was furious,"" said Rochelle Williams, who started the group Blue CD2 NM last year to help elect a Democrat to represent the state's 2nd Congressional District. ""I don't want an insurrectionist representing me."" STAY CONNECTED For assistance, you can reach out to my office at 575-252-6188 or 202-224-6621.

Preventing A Government Shutdown And Securing Funding For Community Projects Earlier today, I joined my colleagues in voting to pass the bipartisan funding package to prevent a government shutdown, fund federal programs, and provide local community aid. In addition to ensuring the continuing operations of our government, I'm glad to see this bill also includes bipartisan provisions I led that will expand programs to combat distracted driving, strengthen sanctions enforcement against Vladimir Putin's inner circle, and reduce the levels of toxic heavy metals in baby food through the FDA's Closer To Zero program, which was created following my investigation into neurotoxins in baby food . Beyond the bill's federal policy implications, I was proud to secure more than $13.6 million in Community Project Funding for communities in our district to address some of the most pressing needs of local families and organizations. Those projects are: $3,000,000 for the Association for Individual Development to build a Community Mental Health Center and social services facility in Elgin, IL. $2,391,407 for the Gail Borden Public Library District's South Elgin Branch expansion, which will create a dedicated space for children and families, as well as additional meeting and programming areas in South Elgin, IL. $2,000,000 for Boys & Girls Clubs of Dundee Township for the Woodlands Community Impact Center, a new community center that will provide under-resourced, minority youth with proven afterschool and summer programs in Carpentersville, IL. $1,000,000 for Cook County Health to provide urgent care access to the surrounding area in Arlington Heights, IL. $936,000 to Elgin Community College to launch its Mechatronics/Automation Certificate Program in Elgin, IL. $750,000 for the Village of Roselle for designing drainage improvements for the Seasons 4 and Devlin Watersheds. $600,000 for the Village of Addison for repairing roads, addressing drainage issues, replacing sidewalks, and adding curb ramps for accessibility. $600,000 for the Village of Hanover Park for replacing the ultraviolet disinfection system at the Village's wastewater treatment plant. $500,000 for the Elk Grove Village Police Department for its Elk Grove Village Cares Program to fund addiction treatment. $500,000 for Harper College for its Aviation Maintenance Program to provide training opportunities in Palatine, IL for students pursuing careers in the aviation industry. $330,400 for the Village of Streamwood for the Madison Drive Bike & Pedestrian Trail. $324,475 for the Wood Dale Park District for its Central Park Redevelopment Project to install swings, child play features, and adult fitness stations. $266,059 for Leyden Family Service & Mental Health Center to support repairs and upgrades to inpatient and outpatient substance abuse treatment facilities in Hoffman Estates, IL. $250,000 for the Jobs for America's Graduates (JAG) to launch new career pathways and counseling support for 9 th and 10 th grade students in District 214, which includes Arlington Heights, Elk Grove, and Palatine. $166,000 for the Village of Schaumburg for its electric vehicle pilot program. Eliminating The Threat Posed By The Chinese Communist Party's Control Over TikTok Last week, I joined my colleagues in the House and Senate in introducing the bipartisan Averting the National Threat of Internet Surveillance, Oppressive Censorship and Influence, and Algorithmic Learning by the Chinese Communist Party Act (ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act) , which would bar TikTok and other social media platforms owned by media companies based in hostile countries, including Russia, North Korea, Iran, and the People's Republic of China (PRC), from operating in the United States as long as they are owned or controlled by foreign adversaries. While all social media companies collect data on their users, what distinguishes TikTok as a national security threat in particular is the control that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has over ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, and the data it stores from TikTok, which has more than 140 million American users. The app can physically track users and online activities while curating information for individuals. Fundamentally, this presents a profoundly effective tool for one of our leading international adversaries to spy on Americans while also feeding them propaganda curated by the CCP itself. The key to understanding the risks posed by TikTok lies in understanding the CCP's control over the app through two PRC laws that ensure that the CCP is able to control the policies of companies based in the country, and that all such companies are required to fully cooperate with the CCP's intelligence agencies. The PRC's 1993 Company Law requires companies based in the country to maintain internal Party cells to ensure the CCP's interests are represented in corporate activities, while the PRC's National Intelligence Law of 2017 requires all citizens and businesses to assist in CCP intelligence work, including sharing data, while banning them from disclosing when they have done so. Together, ByteDance is required by PRC law to cooperate with the CCP's intelligence operations. The company itself is also directed by an internal CCP cell, chaired by the company's editor-in-chief, who has previously stated that ByteDance must ensure that TikTok and other ByteDance products have ""correct political direction."" The CCP's control over a social media app capable of tracking the real-world movements and online activities of Americans, while serving them propaganda selected by the regime in Beijing, poses a serious national security risk. This is compounded by leaks from ByteDance that confirm that not only does TikTok have the capacity to track Americans, it's already planning to do so. In October, Forbes came out with a report , based on internal documents from ByteDance's Internal Audit and Risk Control department, that the company had planned to use the app to monitor the personal locations of individual Americans for surveillance purposes unrelated to advertising. Just yesterday, we learned that the company was deliberately using the app to track the locations of journalists investigating it. While my legislation to eliminate the security threat posed by TikTok or similar apps is the first of its kind, I'm glad to see growing momentum for federal action. While the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Pentagon have already prohibited the use of the app on government-issued devices, I'm glad that we were able to ensure that the bipartisan government funding package included a provision to ban the app from government devices because of the security threats it poses to our nation. As much as Americans may enjoy the content on TikTok, our first priority must be protecting our citizens and our country from the threats posed by hostile foreign powers, and that's precisely what my bipartisan legislation will do.

284," News from Representative Larson Dear Friends, Today, I voted for a year-end funding package that will deliver real results for Connecticut's First District. I am proud to have secured over $38.7 million for local projects to support victims of gun violence, move our infrastructure projects forward, and provide our community members with resources like workforce training and financial literacy programs. Securing Funding for Local Projects This year's government funding package is investing in Connecticut's workforce. I secured $16 million to open the new Connecticut Manufacturing Technology & Innovation Center , which will expand the Connecticut Center for Advanced Technology's (CCAT) research capabilities and workforce development opportunities, as well as $2.2 million to support advanced manufacturing programs at Goodwin University as well as new scholarships for their nursing program. $1.8 million is on its way to two Hartford-area organizations who work with families impacted by gun violence: Mothers United Against Violence and Hartford Communities That Care. They will train and employ Violence Prevention Professionals and offer direct support to impacted families and survivors. I secured nearly $16 million to advance critical infrastructure projects across the District, including upgrades to the levee systems along the Connecticut River, reshaping Windsor Center to make it more pedestrian-friendly, and building walkable, bikeable bridges to link communities on both sides of the River. The Hispanic Federation will receive $650,000 to develop and offer financial literacy training in both English and Spanish, and the Connecticut Historical Society will launch the Educating for Democracy Project to teach history and advance civics education for K-12 students statewide. Delivering Home Heating Assistance The severe weather we are facing is a reminder of the importance of home heating assistance for Connecticut families this winter. In September, the Connecticut delegation and I secured an additional $20 million to support the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program. With rising energy costs, we successfully urged for the inclusion of additional funding to ensure families who qualify for assistance can get the support they need to heat their homes. To see if you qualify and apply for home heating assistance, click here . Standing with Ukraine We heard firsthand from President Zelenskyy that American aid has made a difference in the Ukrainian people's fight against Putin's unprovoked aggression, which is why I was proud to again support more assistance for Ukraine in the year-end funding package. This $45 billion dollar economic and military aid package will support the Ukrainian people and help defend global democracy in the face of Putin's invasion. It is not only in Ukraine's, but in America's best interest. I will continue to fight for more federal funding and resources for Connecticut's First District in the new year.

285," Wittman Votes Against $1.7 Trillion Spending Bill Wittman Votes Against $1.7 Trillion Spending Bill WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, Congressman Rob Wittman (VA-01) released the following statement after voting ""no"" on Senate Amendment to H.R. 2617 - FY23 Omnibus Appropriations, a $1.7 trillion spending bill. ""Congress had months to properly fund our government; yet, we have once again found ourselves in a completely avoidable situation. I have said time and time again that last-minute deals and temporary fixes are no way to govern. To make matters worse, Congress has not passed all appropriations bills on time since 1997 - this is completely unacceptable.

286," News from Representative Bourdeaux A weekly summary of Congresswoman Carolyn Bourdeaux's work for Georgia's 7th Congressional District. WEEK 51 (December 18) Happy Holidays and Happy New Year! This is Congresswoman Carolyn Bourdeaux's last Weekly Wrap-up. The Congresswoman and her staff in Washington, D.C., and in Georgia have been honored to serve you these past two years. This week, the Congresswoman was back in Washington D.C. to finish up the 117th Congress, as both the House of Representatives and Senate came together to pass an omnibus appropriations spending bill to allocate federal funds for fiscal year 2023 (FY23) and avert a government shutdown. The Senate passed the spending package during the day Thursday, followed by the House passage on Friday. This legislation includes critical items including safeguarding the certification of presidential elections; improving maternal and child healthcare access; increasing funding for key priorities such as Pell grants and support for local law enforcement; providing critical aid to Ukraine, and improving benefits associated with certain 401(k) retirement plans. The text of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 is available here . A full summary of the appropriations provisions in the bill is here . A summary of the disaster supplemental is here , and a one-page fact sheet is here . A summary of the Ukraine supplemental is here . The authorizing section-by-section is here . On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Washington to meet with both President Biden and Congress. This is the first time President Zelenskyy has left Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion in February, and delivered a message of gratitude and a need for more support in a special Joint Session of Congress. During his visit, President Biden announced the United States will send a Patriot anti-missile battery to Ukraine's aid, and later in the week, Congress approved an additional $45 billion dollars in emergency aid to Ukraine. The Weekly Rundown Congresswoman Bourdeaux delivered her farewell address on Wednesday, where she highlighted her accomplishments in Washington as well as the effort to hold our country together in the face of a concerted effort to undermine our democratic processes. Watch here . Georgia To Washington, DC Congresswoman Bourdeaux and her staff are hard at work for the community. Here's what her team is getting done for Georgia's 7th Congressional District!

Passing with more than 160 cosponsors, this legislation allows governments to spend $10 million or 30% of their total fiscal relief funding for categories like the National Highway Performance Program, the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program, the Community Development Block Grant, and the Highway Safety Improvement Program.

287," Dear Nevadan, Happy holidays! I hope you're able to take some time to share this holiday season with your families and loved ones. As we reflect on 2022, I'm so proud of everything my office and I were able to accomplish for Nevadans through casework, bipartisan legislation, and community outreach. Here are some of this year's accomplishments by the numbers. I was also proud to help pass some major bills that will benefit all Nevadans, including: The Inflation Reduction Act to help lower prescription drug prices and invest in clean energy. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to help reduce gun violence and increase mental health resources. The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act , which includes my provisions on STEM education, workforce development, and critical minerals. The annual bipartisan national defense bill , which includes a well-deserved pay raise for our troops, strengthens our national security, and brings more than $50 million for military construction projects to our state. Check out some of my favorite highlights from this past year on the work we did to benefit Nevadans, including creating good-paying jobs, lowering health care costs, tackling gun violence, supporting our military, and so much more. To read a full list of our accomplishments this past year, click here . We also faced some serious challenges this year. I will never stop fighting for reproductive freedoms in the wake of a devastating ruling by the Supreme Court to overturn a woman's right to make decisions over their own bodies. I'm also committed to combating antisemitism as it continues to rear its ugly head all over our nation. And I'll always stand up for Dreamers and continue urging my colleagues to come to the negotiating table and push for comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship. It's an honor to serve you and our entire state in the United States Senate, and I look forward to continuing to support hard-working families as we strengthen our economy and create good-paying jobs.

288," Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! I wish you and your loved ones all the best during this holiday season. Website Meet Mark 2nd District Issues News ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ December 23, 2022 Dear Friend, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! I wish you and your loved ones all the best during this holiday season. It has been an honor to serve you - and Nevada. I'm grateful for everyone who has contacted me and my office to share thoughts, questions, and concerns over the past year. In the new year, I hope you continue to communicate directly with us on the issues most important to you. Please also continue to use our office as a resource as you navigate the federal government. As always, next Congress, I will continue to keep you apprised of legislative action in Congress, work on the Appropriations Committee, what to expect ahead, and important updates for Nevada. Here are just a few of this year's highlights from our office: WASHINGTON WRAP-UP As we come to the close of the 117th Congress, essentially, it has been business as usual in Washington, D.C., where Democrats in Congress and the White House have failed to address the escalating economic, border, energy, and crime crises we face today, and have managed to, once again, wait until the eleventh hour to narrowly avert a government shutdown. While the crises we face can seem overwhelming, you should anticipate that these issues will be directly addressed at the start of the new Congress with a Republican House Majority. To give you a sense of what to expect from the Republican Majority in the 118th Congress, here are the most pressing issues I look forward to tackling out of the gate: Inflation and rising costs for everyday goods and energy sources; Escalating crime in our communities; Open borders leading to an unprecedented influx of illegal immigrants; and Holding the Administration accountable, and ensuring it's policies reflect the federal statutes and values of Nevada's 2nd District. Addressing these very real problems will be challenging with Democrats still holding the Senate and White House, but I look forward to House Republicans offering solutions rather than perpetuating these ongoing crises. EXPECTED CHALLENGES FOR THE ﻿NEW MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE In 2011, the discretionary spending portion of the federal budget was $1.3 trillion. In 2022, that same portion of the budget was $1.5 trillion. Also of note, discretionary spending in 2011- on issues such as defense, education, housing, and transportation - were 37% of the federal budget on an annual basis. Now that portion is down to 24%. Discretionary spending as a proportion of the total federal budget has decreased, while mandatory spending has dramatically increased. In the 118th Congress, we will be tasked with reining in the mandatory out-of-control spending - which bypasses the Appropriations process - we've seen grow over the past five years, while also ensuring that the needs of the American people are met. As we go through 118th Congress budget discussions - from health to education to defense and border security - here are some facts to remember from over the past 10 years: Mandatory spending, including entitlements and interest on our nation's debt, has increased from $2.2 trillion to $4.8 trillion, and has risen as a proportion of total federal spending from 63% to 76%. Discretionary spending levels have decreased from roughly 37% of total federal spending (discretionary and mandatory) to 24%. You should rightfully anticipate that much of my work on the Appropriations Committee will be focused on reducing wasteful and woke government spending. At the same time, I will work hard to direct funding towards border security, reduced crime, and specific community projects important to everyday citizens in our country and in Nevada. Working to reduce the seemingly insurmountable burden of the National Debt while the federal government is spending exponentially more money per year is no small task, so this must be a team effort that will take the right dose of collaboration, compromise, homework, and sensibility. THE RACE FOR THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE All eyes are on the race that will determine who will be the next Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. The vote is set for January 3rd. While Kevin McCarthy won a supermajority of the support from the House Republican Conference in our closed-door vote, the official vote on the House floor will not come until January. Presently, it appears that somewhere between 90% and 95% of House Republicans support Kevin McCarthy. Here are the scenarios: To be Speaker, you need 218 votes - which is a simple majority - to be elected if all 435 Members of the House are present. If less than the 218 Members are present, the Speaker needs a majority of the votes from Members of Congress who are present on that day. If no one receives a majority of the votes from present Members that day, the office remains vacant, and the chamber keeps voting until someone achieves the majority. If Members fail to elect a Speaker by majority vote, a proposal can be voted on that would change the process for the Speaker's election. Once the Speaker is elected, we expect to hit the ground running on critical issues the 117th Congress has failed to address - unleashing American energy, securing the southern border, addressing rampant crime in our cities and towns, and eliminating reckless spending, to name a few. END-OF-YEAR CHAOS IN WASHINGTON: ﻿FY23 OMNIBUS After this Administration and the present Majority Party in Congress have spent over $3 trillion dollars over the course of the past two years on their ""woke"" agendas that have increased taxes on American businesses, weaponized the IRS, attacked American energy, and reduced access to innovative and life-saving treatment and care, I find it hardly surprising Democrats in Washington have decided to force through an Omnibus spending bill on a partisan basis. Moreover, once again, we are faced with a bill at the eleventh hour - right before Christmas - to narrowly avert a government shutdown. How phenomenally disrespectful to the American public. This lame duck session should have been an opportunity for collaboration, as has been done nearly every year prior, to address our crumbling economy, undeniable recession, runaway inflation, and supply shortages in a fiscally responsible way. What should be a ""clean bill"" - is instead a $1.8 trillion-dollar, 4,155-page bill laden with partisan initiatives. There are many specific poison pills in this Omnibus spending bill and areas of concern regarding the process in which it was forced to the House floor. Some provisions and concerns are as follows: Prohibiting funds for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to extend or maintain border security technology and capabilities, despite historic encounters at the border; Insufficient funding for hiring additional Border Patrol Agents, while at the same time spending billions for new IRS Agents; Advancing billions in funding for Green New Deal energy agendas after spending $370 billion on woke climate initiatives in the Inflation Reduction Act; Additional $12.3 billion in funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) after an alarming $80 billion was passed in the Inflation Reduction Act to hire 87,000 new IRS agents; Providing $2.3 million to push students to enroll in Biden's unlawful student loan debt cancellation program; and Waiving statutory PAYGO (pay as you go) cuts, which will add an additional $260 billion to the national debt. While Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee have fought - and succeeded - in keeping certain provisions in the Omnibus, like the Hyde Amendment, which protect Americans from the taxpayer funding of abortions, and while a ""no"" vote does risk a government shutdown, I cannot in good conscience look people in the eyes and say everything is just dandy with the bill put forward by Democrats in Congress. While I have typically taken the stance that voting against funding bills is not a productive path forward, Americans deserve solutions to the crises at hand and not more out-of-control, agenda-driven spending.

""At no time in modern history has the outgoing Majority in Congress - with one foot out the door - rammed through an omnibus spending package during a Lame Duck session. This closing act will bring new spending totals, in just two short years of one-party Democrat control in Washington, to more than $5 trillion. ""On November 8, the American people made their voices heard by voting in a new Republican Majority to the House of Representatives to curb the runaway spending that is fueling record-high prices and making our country less safe. This reckless spending is a direct affront to the will of the voters. ""The 4,126-page, $1.8 trillion spending spree takes the problem of record-high inflation from bad to worse and adds hundreds of billions more to our already massive national debt. ""Among the many disastrous ironies buried in this omnibus spending package is a provision barring border patrol from investing in proven methods to curb the flow of illegal drugs and migrants across our southern border while simultaneously investing $410 million to secure the borders of Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia, and Oman."" ### Office Locations WASHINGTON, DC OFFICE 2429 Rayburn HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-5355 WORTHINGTON OFFICE 250 East Wilson Bridge Rd Suite 100 Worthington, OH 43085 Phone: (614) 523-2555 --> To download a high-resolution headshot of Congressman Troy Balderson, click here.

Dear Friend, We're fast approaching the end of another year. There's no doubt that there has been many times this last year when folks were rightfully concerned about the direction our country was heading in. Policies and priorities matter and that's never been more obvious. We'll have a new majority in Congress next year and things have to look different-they must look different. That's enough about that, though. Christmas is here and hopefully you are already focused on what's truly meaningful in this season. As I reflect, I just wanted to take a minute and say how thankful I am to be your representative. North Missouri continues to amaze me time and again with all the wonderful things happening and the tenacity and resilience of our friends and neighbors. Despite record inflation, we're making progress. When tragedy happens, we rally together. We use the resources we've been blessed with and the people who call this place home and seek to improve our part of the state. That North Missouri spirit is really something to be proud of. While there were many times this year when we lamented the state of things, we can always rest in the fact that things can and do change. While the turning of the calendar page to a new year doesn't automatically improve everything, it certainly gives us a chance to go back and reflect on what went right and decide how where we can improve. I'm confident that we will, and I look forward to doing so. Ultimately, I always go back to the Christmas themes of love, joy, peace, and hope. Christmas is typically a joyous occasion by nature, and I hope that's the case for you this year. Some years are better than others, but we have much to rejoice over, particularly the birth of our Savior. That's why we celebrate. From my family to yours, have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.' And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men."" If you can believe it, Christmas is here! Tomorrow is Christmas Eve, and the excitement is certainly palpable. In my family the anticipation of Santa Claus' upcoming visit has the grandkids trying their hardest to be on their best behavior (not always successfully but they're trying!). And it's always fun to see friends and neighbors around town for the jolliest time of the year. Christmas in Missouri is like nowhere else. While it's going to be a chilly one, it looks like a white Christmas could be very possible this year. And the festivities around our state all month long are the perfect way to get in the spirit and get the kids geared up for Santa Claus' trip down their chimneys. From the Jaycees Christmas parade in Jefferson City, to the festivities that take place almost nightly down Main Street in St. Charles, to the beautiful nativity scenes at churches across our district, Missourians have been preparing for Christmas for weeks. It's almost hard to believe it is here. With all that being said, it is easy to get caught up in the craziness that so often accompanies the Christmas season. The decorating, parties, family gatherings, cookie baking, visits to Santa, and Christmas shopping are all lots of fun, but they can sometimes get overwhelming. I hope you'll join me in slowing down this weekend to remember the true reason for the season: the birth of our Lord. Jesus was born into the most humble beginnings imaginable, and laid in a manger that animals would normally eat from because there was no room for Mary and Joseph at the inn. These humble beginnings can serve as a wonderful reminder that Christmas is not about gifts or decorations, but hope and gratitude. Two things I have a great deal of moving into the next year. Christmas is one of the most joyous days of the year and one I always look forward to spending with my family. After a bit of a crazy 2022, I hope you get a chance to do the same with friends and loved ones. We have so much to be grateful for in this country, our freedom being one of the most important. And we've been afforded this freedom because our military signs up to protect it. Many of them will be missing Christmas with their own families this year, so please join me in praying during this holy season for their safety and their families who are sacrificing for us all. On behalf of my family, I wish you a very Merry Christmas! CONTACT US: I encourage you to visit my official website or call my offices in Jefferson City (573-635-7232) Washington, Mo.

292," Friday, December 23, 2022 WEBSITE | SHARE ON: Foxx Report Across the entire state, families are preparing for various holiday festivities and traveling to spend time with the ones they love. This time of year brings about a profound sense of reflection - where we take pause and think about the real meaning of the season: the birth of Jesus Christ. Further, we take time to think about the many blessings that have been bestowed upon us. One such blessing, that I am reminded of every day, is how we as Americans are incredibly fortunate to live in a magnificent Republic where the right to freely exercise one's faith, whether alone or alongside family and friends, is protected by the Constitution. In this country, we exercise our faith without the fear of retribution from rogue political factions or oppressive government regimes. I believe it should stay that way. We can both agree that our children and grandchildren deserve to live in a free America that is unwavering in its protection of the rights of conscience. In the People's House, I am fighting every day alongside my Republican colleagues to ensure that religious liberty is safeguarded for every American from schools to the workplace. Religious liberty is a monumental pillar of our great country, and we stand ready to defend it. Honoring Master Sergeant Jerry K. Crump This week, my bill, H.R. 5481, which names the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in Forest City, North Carolina, as the ""Master Sergeant Jerry K. Crump VA Clinic"", was signed into law. Master Sergeant Crump's legacy will forever be enshrined in Forest City - a fitting honor for a true partier who served our nation in the Korean War and who demonstrated a willingness to put his life on the line to protect his comrades in the heat of battle. I am incredibly pleased that today, President Biden has signed H.R. 5481 into law, and that the nation will further honor an exemplary American for his service, courage, devotion to the country he was proud to call home.

Free Speech on College Campuses Recently, I took a stand on the floor of the House in support of preserving the First Amendment rights of students. Freedom of speech and thought on college campuses is essential to one of the most important missions of the university: the search for truth. While censorship can come from the right or left, many colleges and universities are now zealously devoted to advancing left-wing ideas and are willing to disregard evidence and logic to do it. Universities should be a marketplace of ideas, not temples to a single political dogma. To watch my full speech, click here .

293," Dear Friend, As families and friends come together this time of year to give thanks and rejoice in the holiday season, Kelley and I would like to offer our very best wishes to all Kentuckians. During this season, let us also pause and remember our brave men and women serving our country and protecting our freedom at home and abroad. We thank you and your families for the sacrifices you make. May your holiday be filled with love and your New Year rich with God's blessings. From our family to yours, Merry Christmas, and Happy Holidays! You can find my latest update below! Dr. Rand Paul Fights to Reign in $1.7 Trillion, 4,000+ Page Pelosi-Schumer End-of-Year Spending Bill In the dead of the night, 1:23AM ET to be exact , Congress released its 4,155-page end-of-year spending bill loaded with wasteful pet projects and Big Government priorities, totaling in at a whopping $1.7 trillion . Last Tuesday, after Big Government Democrats and Republicans got together to put the finishing touches on their boondoggle spending bill, I once again joined a group of five likeminded Senators in expressing opposition to passing their foolish agenda . This type of situation happens every year. Congress passes a spending bill that has no budget. It's typically a spending bill in which everything is glommed together in one. It's a spending bill that's thousands of pages long, and no one will ever read it. No one will have encompassed the entire bill, and it's given with only hours or days before we're supposed to pass it. And there's always a reversal of blame. The blame isn't attached to the people who, frankly, I wouldn't put in charge of running a minute mart because of their lack of business sense. It's not attached to the people who cobbled together a multi-thousand-page bill in the dead of night, didn't show it to anyone and put it forward. They will say if you vote 'no,' or offer any hold up, you are to blame for shutting down the government. I, however, am not for shutting down the government, but am for spending less money and accumulating less debt. On Tuesday, I also spoke on the Senate floor and called for the Senate to abide by its own rules which require spending to be offset by equal cuts from somewhere else. Republicans and Democrats are yet again waiving these rules and allowing the over 4,000 pages of spending to become debt instead of being offset by spending cuts. I know the American people don't want this. You are already paying for it through inflation and adding $1 trillion to the deficit will only make it worse and fuel the fires that are consuming your wages and consuming your retirement plans. It's a terrible system. Someone needs to stand up, and as your Senator I'm proud to say no more to this terrible, awful, no-good way to run government. You can watch the press conference I hosted with Senators Rick Scott (R-FL), Mike Lee (R-UT), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Mike Braun (R-IN) last Tuesday HERE and watch my floor remarks HERE . Dr. Rand Paul Releases 2022 Festivus Report on Government Waste Today, I released my 2022 ""Festivus"" Report, totaling $482,276,543,907 in government waste. This marks my eighth edition of the Festivus Report as I continue working to alert the American people to how their federal government uses their hard-earned money. Some of the highlights include the National Institutes of Health spending $2.3 million injecting beagle puppies with cocaine, and separately spending $187,500 to verify that kids love their pets. The Department of Health and Human Services spent $689,222 to study romance between parrots, the NIH funded a $3 million annual research project to watch hamsters on steroids fight, and the U.S. Census Bureau spent $2.5 million on Super Bowl Ads. That's just a preview of what your government has wasted lately, and there are plenty more egregious items in my full report so be sure to read it HERE . Dr. Rand Paul Honors Cottingham Hardware of Alexandria as Senate Small Business of the Week As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. Recently, I had the privilege of recognizing Cottingham Hardware of Alexandria, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week. Sixty-five years ago, Tom and Betty Cottingham opened Cottingham Hardware, a hardware store right in the heart of the little town of Alexandria, Kentucky. Since its' inception over six decades ago, the store has been dutifully serving its customers, offering them whatever hardware goods they might need, including but not limited to, specialty chrome, electrical lighting, as well as lawn and garden tools. The store also carries a large selection of firearms and ammunition, making the shop especially popular during Northern Kentucky's busy hunting season. In addition to the wide array of products available for purchase at Cottingham, the store has two mechanics who are always available to meet the needs of customers, with both mechanics having received the proper training and certification to handle practically any job. They boast a selection that is appropriate for all types of customers, whether they be a first-time homeowner or the owner of multi-acre properties, they have the products and services to help with any project. Started by a married couple, Cottingham Hardware continues to be a family business. Tom and Betty's three sons practically grew up in the store, so it would only make sense that the three men choose to perpetuate their parents' dream and run the store with the same dedication and customer-friendly atmosphere that Tom and Betty created. The three sons, Tom, Mike, and Joe took over the business in the mid 90's, roughly a decade after Cottingham Hardware moved from their original location right in Alexandria out to U.S. Highway 27. The Cottingham brothers understand that their parents' success was due in large part to their dedication to family values. Tom, Mike, and Joe maintain a strict policy that at least one of the Cottingham brothers is in store at any given time during business hours, all seven days a week. Friends and neighbors are constantly coming through their doors to purchase tools or equipment and to visit with the familiar faces of the Cottingham store. These days even the brothers' children occasionally work with them in store, entering into a new generation of Cottingham family leadership. Moreover, Cottingham Hardware maintains their dedication to the Alexandria community, as they often participate in donations for local schools and churches. Additionally, Joe Cottingham is a member of the Northern Kentucky Area Development District (NKADD), representing Campbell County. Clearly the Cottingham family is dedicated not only to running a successful family business, but to championing and supporting small businesses around the state as well. For that reason, it gives me great pleasure to honor this multi-generation family business as the Senate Small Business of the Week. Congratulations to the Cottingham brothers and the entire team at Cottingham Hardware. I look forward to seeing your continued growth and success in Kentucky.

Important reminders for winter storms: Stay off the roads as much as possible and only drive when absolutely necessary. Always give snowplows and responders the right of way on the road. If you must travel, know the road conditions before you leave by visiting . Never use a generator, grill, camp stove or gasoline, propane, natural gas, or charcoal burning device inside your home, garage, basement, crawlspace or any other partially enclosed area. Snow shoveling is a known trigger for heart attacks. Always avoid overexertion when shoveling. Be sure to check on elderly or disabled neighbors and relatives. Protect yourself from frostbite and keep yourself dry. Wear several layers of clothing along with a hat, mittens, and a scarf. For preparing your home: Make sure your home is properly insulated and check the weather stripping around doors and windows. Learn how to shut off water valves in case of a pipe burst. Have additional heat sources in case of a power outage. Keep a working fire extinguisher accessible and check the batteries in your carbon monoxide detectors. In the event of high winds, secure loose items around your property and trim any branches that could threaten your home. For preparing your car: Batteries lose power as temperatures drop, be sure to have them tested. Check your car's antifreeze level, have your radiator system serviced, replace windshield wiper fluid with a wintertime mix, and proactively replace your car's worn tires and wiper blades. Clean snow and ice off of your car entirely - including your trunk, roof, windows, and headlights - before driving. Be sure to have an emergency winter weather kit in your car if you must travel. This could include items such as: Blankets Enough water and snacks for everyone in the car, including pets Boots First-aid kit Warm clothes and insulating layers (sweatpants, gloves, hat) Shovel and ice-scraper/snow brush Jumper cables Flashlight with extra batteries Portable smartphone power bank Traction aid such as sand or salt Garbage bags For more on how to prepare yourself and your loved ones for winter weather, visit . If you will be traveling, please check road conditions by visiting , by calling 511, or reviewing the 511 Virginia mobile app. For weather warnings, hazards, and updates, be sure to stay up to date with information shared by the Virginia Department of Emergency Management (VDEM), the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), Virginia State Police, National Weather Service, and your local government. Please feel free to share this email with your friends, family, and loved ones to ensure they are prepared for potential weather threats.

295," With your help, we were able to secure over $42 million for Vermont communities. Dear Fellow Vermonter, Earlier this year, I asked you to submit ideas and proposals to my office for projects that would improve our communities and address long-neglected needs across our state. Thanks to those submissions, which covered a wide range of issues, my office was able to secure more than $42 million in federal funding for Vermont communities through Congressionally Directed Spending . From health care and infrastructure to child care, clean energy and water, agriculture, education, and housing, these 51 projects will have a significant impact in our communities and in improving the lives of Vermonters from one end of our state to the other. As you may know, in the last several years we have made strong progress in Vermont expanding access to primary health care. The programs I am announcing today take us a major step forward in continuing that progress with a more than $4 million investment in community health center capabilities in the Brattleboro area - a project that will help thousands of Vermonters access much-needed dental, primary, and behavioral health care. We are also today announcing health care initiatives for Orange County, Franklin County, Washington County, and Chittenden County. One of the goals of my office has been to make quality, affordable community health center care accessible for Vermonters in every region of our state. Because of what we've accomplished together over the years, Vermont now has the highest per-capita use of community health centers in the country, providing quality care to more than 171,000 Vermonters - regardless of ability to pay. That's an accomplishment we should all be proud of. Some other project highlights include: Expanding affordable, shared equity homeownership opportunities for low- and moderate-income Vermonters. Upgrades and renovations to the historic Barre Municipal Auditorium that will ensure families are able to visit and use the Aud for generations to come. Funding to establish the Vermont EMS Academy to provide high-quality and accessible training to help rebuild Vermont's EMS workforce. Funding to quadruple the number of spots at the Vermont State Firefighters Association's Cadet Academy. Clean drinking water and sewer infrastructure projects across the state, including in Royalton, Randolph, Barre, and Whitingham. A new child care center in Morrisville - for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers - to fill an urgent need for families in the region. These Vermont projects, funded through a process known as ""Congressionally Directed Spending,"" passed the Senate this week and will soon be signed into law by President Biden.

296," HOME | ABOUT | MEDIA | SERVICES | ISSUES Washington Has a Spending Problem This week, Congress voted to fund the government, but this did nothing to address our spending problem, and I fear we are reaching a point of no return, which is why I voted against this massive spending bill. Washington has added trillions of dollars to the federal debt in just the last few years, and no one seems to have a sense of urgency about paying back that debt. Members of Congress ram as much funding for their pet projects into spending bills as they can, because they know there is no accountability for that spending. The 2023 omnibus spending bill topped out at about $1.7 trillion. So on top of the American Rescue Plan, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Democrats' reckless tax and spending spree, and last year's appropriations bill, Congress has spent nearly $9 trillion during the last two years. That is unacceptable and unsustainable. I introduced a version of my Sustainable Budget Act as an amendment to the omnibus. This would have created a bipartisan commission tasked with creating a plan to cut the national debt within the next ten years. Unfortunately, that amendment was not included in the final version of the bill. I also cosponsored Senator Ron Johnson's (R-WI) amendment to ban earmarks from the omnibus bill. The earmark process adds billions of dollars in unnecessary spending for pet projects that would not pass muster if left to stand on their own. That amendment failed. I will continue to beat this drum. If we do not address our reckless spending habits, our grandchildren will be left with a bill they have no hope of paying back. Happy Trails, WORKING IN WASHINGTON Legislative Actions: I cosponsored Senator Ron Johnson's (R-WI) amendment to the omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act to strip all earmarks from the bill. Amendments like this help remove unnecessary pork from this massive spending bill. Many folks from Wyoming are concerned about how much Congress is spending, and I am doing all that I can to make sure that this spending is limited. I introduced an amendment to the omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act to establish a national commission (like Simpson-Bowles) to develop legislation addressing the United States' fiscal deficit and debt. Folks in Wyoming are extremely concerned about the repercussions that they face from our nation's excessive spending. Amendments like this help put America back on the path to fiscal responsibility. Major Votes: Motion to proceed to H.R. 2617, the legislative vehicle for FY2023 Omnibus Appropriations Opposed This $1.7 trillion spending package is irresponsible. It is time to seriously pursue spending cuts and budget reform to protect the financial well-being of our nation and the people across Wyoming. WORKING IN WYOMING As a frigid cold snap blows across Wyoming, I am hearing concerns about rising propane prices and delayed deliveries. Arctic blasts like this are extremely dangerous, and folks in Wyoming need to be able to properly heat their homes. Many in rural areas rely on propane-fueled generators. Right now, Wyoming is projected to have the 16th highest monthly gas bills in the nation this winter. We need to unleash American energy and harness the natural resources we are blessed with here in Wyoming. I cosponsored the Real Emergencies Act, which clarifies that President Biden does not have the authority to declare a national emergency and limit natural gas production on the premise of climate change. To address the supply chain and delivery issues, I introduced the LICENSE Act to help get more truck drivers on the road. In the meantime, Governor Gordon has announced a statewide emergency to improve propane supplies. Please stay safe this week and follow the National Weather Service guidelines as we head into the holiday weekend.

297," Merry Christmas! My Thoughts Following the Unfortunate Passage of the $1.7 Trillion Omnibus The fact that we spend money this way is a problem. The group think that goes into this is a problem. It makes us all poorer and less free. It also disenfranchises over 300 million Americans whose elected representatives are cut out entirely from any, say in what their government spends. We can do better and we must. Media Opinion: Defense Department Should Support Falsely Imprisoned Serviceman The Deseret News Editorial Board says, ""Evidence shows Navy Lt. Ridge Alkonis did nothing criminal. He suffered a medical emergency that caused him to black out. But now the Biden administration is suspending his pay. We applaud Utah Sen.

299," Merry Christmas! Christmas carols are by far my favorite type of music because they tell such a great story-the story of Christmas. They tell how on a silent, holy night 2,000 years ago, a teenage virgin gave birth to the Son of God. While nostalgic for sure, Christmas is much more than sentimentalism. Certainly opening presents from under the tree and delivered by Santa Claus brings smiles to children's faces, but it is the ultimate gift that brings eternal joy. Then join the angels and sing about him away in a manger when all is calm and all is bright. Take it to heart; it will change your life. From my family to yours, have a Merry Christmas and a blessed and happy New Year!

300," Dear  , Earlier this week, I was glad to see my bipartisan ""Putting First Responders First Act"" pass the U.S. Senate. The story of Billings Police Officer Ladd Paulson inspired me to introduce my bill to clarify the current tax code to ensure first responders do not have to pay taxes on injury-related compensation when hurt in the line of duty. Listen to Ladd and his wife Heidi discuss their fight to get this bill passed and the impact it would have on them and other families of first responders who were injured on the job. First responders who have dedicated their life to serving our communities should never be targeted by the IRS. After risking their lives and sometimes suffering life-threatening injuries, the last thing Montana's first responders should have to worry about is burdensome taxes and audits. I'm glad to fight for families like the Paulsons and will always back the blue. Sincerely, Senator Steve Daines   ",Daines

305," News from Congressman Brian Mast THE RIVER KIDZ - 11 YEARS LATER   - Four years ago, a courageous group of kids from the Treasure Coast visited Washington, D.C. to fight for their community. Growing up fishing, boating and spending time on the water, the River Kidz were concerned that their home - the place where they had made their best memories - was being destroyed by toxic algae. They took the fight directly to Washington to appeal to lawmakers and show them just how much damage this problem really causes. They weren't going to wait for the adults to take action, this was their home too. They couldn't vote, but they were going to make their voices heard. And they did. The River Kidz made an impact that lasts to this day. Now, over a decade after a brave group of fourth graders founded the group, and four years since they walked the halls of Congress, they're reflecting on that impact.

306," Dear Friends, As the year comes to an end, I'd like to highlight one of the most important services that my Congressional office provides - helping the people of our district with federal agencies! I'm pleased to share some of our success stories from 2022. This year, our casework team closed 688 cases. We also saved a grand total of $320,448 for constituents. We know that working with federal agencies can sometimes be hard or confusing. If you are having a problem with a federal agency, our office may be able to help!

While we cannot guarantee you a favorable outcome, we will do our best to help you receive a fair and timely response to your problem. Around the District On Tuesday, I kicked off my Farm-to-Congress listening tour at the Santa Fe Farmers Market Institute to learn your priorities for the 2023 Farm Bill and discuss how we can improve services for New Mexicans, fill gaps and remove barriers. The Farm Bill provides critical funding for years of key nutrition and agriculture programs. Your input and your suggestions are key to the success of this legislation, and with your help, we can make a Farm Bill that works for all of us in 2023. It was wonderful to join the Taos community and National Guard on Monday to mark the 37th year of Taos Feeds Taos! Taos Feeds Taos is a shining example of comunidad coming together to uplift the most vulnerable. Legislative Corner I proudly secured another $1.45 billion in Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon recovery funding in the end-of-year omnibus package. This additional funding is what justice looks like - the federal government taking responsibility for the harm it caused. I recently co-led the National Laboratory Biotechnology Research Act with Representative Bill Foster to make sure our scientists continue their important work to protect Americans from current and future public health threats. Some of the bills that I recently voted for, and the House passed include: S. 1942, the National Heritage Area Act to reauthorize the Northern Rio Grande National Heritage Area and several others throughout the country. S. 989, the Native American Language Resource Center Act to improve the teaching and learning of Native American languages for students of all ages.

These grants are for deploying high-speed internet networks and developing digital skills training programs under the Internet for All initiative. Texas is receiving the funds form the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to plan for the deployment and adoption of affordable, equitable, and reliable high-speed Internet service throughout the state. Whether it's helping our children access their online assignments or connecting patients with their telehealth appointments, the Internet has become a daily part of our lives. The necessity for broadband and high-speed internet has never been greater. I voted for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law last year to bridge the digital divide for those who lack reliable internet access. Today's award is the first step in ensuring the entire State of Texas is online and prepared for the everchanging world of tomorrow. Texas will receive $5 million through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program to fund various activities including: Helping close the broadband availability gap and the development of a Five-Year Action Plan; Research and data collection, including initial identification of unserved locations and underserved locations; Publications, outreach, and communications support. The BEAD Program provides funding to expand high-speed Internet access by funding planning, infrastructure deployment and adoption programs. Additionally, Texas will receive $3,110,148.10 from the Digital Equity Act to fund various activities including: Helping close the digital equity gap and the development of a Statewide Digital Equity Plan; Soliciting proposals through a competitive procurement process and issue contracts to support the development of the state digital equity plan; Working directly with organizations and nonprofits to reach the covered populations identified; Fostering partnerships by holding frequent subgrantee roundtables and other engagement activities; Establishing a digital equity planning coalition comprised of each subgrantee and potential other partners around the state. The Digital Equity Act provides funding to establish three grant programs to ensure that all people and communities have the skills, technology, and capacity needed to reap the full benefits of our digital economy.

308," NEWS ALERT! Sen. Rick Scott Warns Floridians About IRS Overreach, New $600 Transaction Reporting Requirement Senate Democrats Block Sen. Rick Scott's Amendment to Stop IRS Spying, Expansion Senator Rick Scott secured a full vote of the United States Senate on his amendment to the week-long continuing resolution to stop the IRS from adding 87,000 new agents to audit families and small businesses. Senator Scott's amendment would also repeal a provision that allows the IRS to spy on every financial transaction of more than $600 made with Americans' bank accounts through vendors like CashApp, Venmo and PayPal. Although a bipartisan group, including all Senate Republicans, supported the amendment, Senate Democrats ultimately blocked its approval. Watch Senator Scott's speech in support of his amendment HERE or below. Sen. Rick Scott on Senate Floor: Americans Have Had Enough of Washington's Dysfunctional Spending Senator Rick Scott spoke on the Senate floor in support of Senator Ron Johnson's request to unanimously pass a clean continuing resolution (CR) that would keep the government funded through February 4th, 2023, after Republicans have taken the majority in the House of Representatives. This is the latest action taken over the past several months to support the passage of a CR until after the start of the 118th Congress. Senators Rick Scott and Mike Lee wrote an op-ed for Fox News demanding the passage of a clean CR that extends government funding until after the new Congress begins in 2023. Last month, Senator Scott joined Senators Lee, Ted Cruz and Mike Braun in writing a letter to leadership expressing the need to pass a short-term CR that funds the federal government only until shortly after the 118th Congress is sworn in. Additionally, in September, Senator Scott, along with Senators Cruz and Lee, demanded the passage of a clean CR that simply maintains current federal functions and programs until a new Congress begins in 2023. Watch Senator Scott's speech HERE or below. Sen. Rick Scott Pens Open Letter to Job Seekers: Don't Work for Biden's IRS Army Senator Rick Scott released the below open letter to America's job seekers outlining several factors they should consider before applying for a job with Biden's soon-to-be supersized Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This month, Congressional Democrats passed a massive, partisan and reckless tax-and-spend bill which gives the IRS an additional $80 billion in taxpayer dollars and the authority to hire 87,000 new - mostly armed - IRS agents. Senator Scott first released this open letter to job seekers on his new LinkedIn account . Read the full letter HERE . How Will This Impact You? Previously, the IRS required companies like Cash App, Venmo, PayPal to issue Form 1099-K to individuals to report certain payment transactions that had: Payments that exceeded $20,000, AND More than 200 transactions within the current year To comply with a new law passed by Democrats in Congress and signed by President Biden, Floridians must now receive the Form1099-K for payments of all goods and services in excess of $600. In short, this new law 1) brings down the transaction payment threshold from $20,000 to $600 and 2) removes the minimum threshold of 200 transaction per year. Questions and Answers How will this work? You will receive a Form 1099-K from a Venmo or PayPal (third party network) for income received through electronic forms of payments by Jan. 31 of the following year. In the near future, your third-party provider may request additional information from you to properly report your transactions on the Form 1099-K. You may be asked to provide your Employer Identification Number (EIN), Individual Tax Identification Number (ITIN) or Social Security Number (SSN) if this information is not on file. Your Form 1099-K will report the total gross income in Box 1a received during the year without considering any adjustments, discounts, or refunds. Your Form 1099-K will include payments from credit cards and online payments. You are required to report any income listed on your Form 1099-K from your business on your income tax return. Does Venmo, Cash-App and Other Third-Party Network Users Have to Pay a New Tax? No. While this new law requires new tax reporting requirements, it does not change the existing tax law, meaning taxable or nontaxable for tax reporting. Form 1099-K is an informational tax form and may include amounts considered excluded from gross income for tax purposes. If you receive money considered a nontaxable source, you will not need to report on your tax return. Some examples of money received that may be excluded from your income are: Money received from a friend as a reimbursement Money received from a roommate to pay their share of the rent Money received from a loved one as a gift Also, if you receive money from selling a personal item at a loss, you are not required to report the amount on your tax return. For example, if you purchased a dress for $100 and sold it for $50, the amount is not taxable. But while it does not create a new tax, you must keep good records of any taxable income received. How to Keep Good Records for Cash App Reporting Since your Form 1099-K may include both taxable and nontaxable income, keeping good records is essential. While you may choose any recordkeeping system for your business, you want to select a system that reflects your income and expenses. Your system should include: Accounting and payroll records. Bank statements. Receipts. Tax forms and returns. Other business financial records. You can consider saving your records either in electronic form or manually. If you are a business owner, it is a good idea to set up separate third-party payment accounts for your business and personal transactions. This way, you can easily track business transactions.

309," Government Funding Bill Includes Important Priorities for New Hampshire On a bipartisan basis, the Senate came together to pass the end-of-year government funding bill. I was pleased that the final bill contained critical New Hampshire priorities that I worked to secure. These measures will lower costs for families, strengthen our response to the opioid epidemic, and help more Americans save for retirement, among other important priorities. See below for some of the key measures that I worked to secure in the final bill, based on priorities that Granite Staters have shared with me: Helping Granite Staters heat their homes: Increased funding for a program that helps some Granite Staters afford their home heating costs. Improving housing supply: Funding to help with the construction of thousands of new rental units and houses in New Hampshire and across the country. Lowering drug prices: My bipartisan measure to help lower drug prices by increasing access to generic and biosimilar medications , which are often less expensive than generic drugs. Expanding access to life-saving medication: Bipartisan legislation that I crafted to expand access to life-saving medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. My bill eliminates an outdated requirement, the x-waiver, that needlessly limits the number of medical practitioners who can prescribe buprenorphine, the gold-standard for treating opioid use disorder. Making it easier to save for retirement: A bipartisan provision I supported to help more Americans save for retirement by making it easier for businesses to offer retirement benefits, including enabling more businesses to join multiple employer plans (MEPs) and expanding tax cuts to small businesses that provide retirement benefits to their employees. You can find a list of additional measures that I worked to secure in the government funding bill here , and I look forward to seeing this important bill signed into law very soon. Finally, with the holiday season upon us, I hope everyone can enjoy time with their loved ones and reflect on the past year. I am grateful every day to represent Granite Staters in the Senate. With every good wish, Senator Maggie Hassan Photo of the Week Chip, along with the rest of the family, wishes everyone a merry and joyful holiday season.

From the Blackburn family to yours, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! A very Happy Hanukkah to the Jewish community in Tennessee, across our nation, and around the world. Weekly Rundown With Christmas just around the corner, I put together the ultimate holiday playlist. Check out some of my favorite tunes to get into the holiday spirit! While our military recruitment was at a record low , the Biden administration continued to force servicemembers to choose between taking a shot and defending our country. As a Senate Armed Services Committee member, I fought for six months to repeal this mandate. I am pleased to announce that the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act put our national security first and fully repealed the COVID vaccine mandate moving forward. Find out more about my fight and its significance in my New York Post op-ed here . It is unacceptable that approximately 38% of women have experienced sexual harassment at work.

311," Dear Friend, I am thrilled to share some good end-of-year news: the Senate just voted 92-5 to add my bipartisan Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act into the year-end government funding bill. We must make it possible for every new mom returning to the workplace to have the option to continue breastfeeding-an option that is also really good for businesses. With this bill, parents will be empowered to make their own choices on breastfeeding, and businesses can improve retention of valuable employees. With the passage of this bill, 9 million American workers will now have the protections and support to pump at work so they can return to their jobs and continue breastfeeding. It's a win-win-win. Next stop? The big funding bill, with the PUMP Act included, is headed to the U.S. House of Representatives, and then to President Biden's desk to be signed into law! It's a great day for families and a great day for businesses!

312," December 22, 2022 Dear Friend, As we approach the holidays, I am taking stock of all that we have accomplished together over this past year. We made historic strides to protect our children's future on this planet, lower health care and energy costs for hardworking families, invest in economic development and competitiveness, assist New Mexicans as they recover and rebuild from a devastating wildfire season, deliver important benefits to our heroic military veterans, and to reduce deadly gun violence in our communities. I hope you can take a moment to read a brief recap. Please also watch and share the video below highlighting some of our greatest achievements from 2022. VIDEO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich highlights 2022 accomplishments. Early childhood education for all of our kids New Mexico families will soon benefit from universal early childhood education and care. After over a decade-long effort, we have taken the final step to unlock major investments in our children at the level they have long deserved and change the trajectory of our state. I have been proud to stand alongside many parents, educators and children's advocates to call for these stronger investments in our children's education. I was the first member of New Mexico's Congressional Delegation to support investing more of the resources in our state's $26 billion Land Grant Permanent Fund in early childhood education. PHOTO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich stands with early childhood teachers and children's advocates to support groundbreaking investments in early childhood education, June 27, 2022. New Mexico voters approved the historic Constitutional Amendment One on this year's ballot to make these investments to support our children's education. The amendment directs New Mexico to allocate 1.25% of the growth of the fund to our children's education. An annual estimated contribution of around $250 million a year will direct approximately $150 million each year to proven early childhood education and support programs and $100 million to K-12 education. I successfully led the effort-alongside Senator Luján and Representatives Stansbury and Leger Fernández-to pass the federal consent that the New Mexico Legislature requested, in addition to approval from voters, to ratify the state constitutional amendment. We secured our bill that follows the will of New Mexico voters as part of the bipartisan Omnibus Appropriations Agreement that Congress just passed. Unlocking this funding will jumpstart a massive transformation and improvement of our state's education system-from early childhood on-by investing in our children at the level they have long deserved. Changing our trajectory on climate The Inflation Reduction Act-the monumental health care and climate law that President Biden signed this year-will tackle pressing challenges that families are facing today and make investments to build a stronger future for our kids. It will help us fight inflation, lower health care and prescription drug costs, and finally make the tax code fairer and no longer rigged in favor of corporations and the ultra-rich. Taken as a whole, the Inflation Reduction Act is the single greatest action that we have ever taken to change the trajectory of the climate crisis. The incentives and consumer rebates will move the needle on climate further than ever before by accelerating the widespread deployment of reliable, affordable, and pollution-free power generation and supercharge American manufacturing base for emerging clean and electric technologies-from air-source heat pumps and wind turbines to batteries, solar components, and electric vehicles. PHOTO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich celebrates the Inflation Reduction Act becoming law with labor leaders at the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters Local Union 412 in Albuquerque, September 9, 2022. Once the new rebates that I championed in the law start to roll out, new highly efficient, fully-electric, and climate pollution-free vehicles and home appliances will help millions of families lower their energy bills and improve their health. The buildout of clean energy infrastructure and household electrification will also create good paying union jobs. I was adamant that all of the new work supported by this law will pay prevailing wages and hire registered apprentices. That's how we will ensure that local wages are not undercut by low-road contractors. Rebuilding from wildfire season This spring, the Hermit's Peak-Calf Canyon Fire destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses, and it displaced thousands of New Mexicans for weeks and months on end. When I have visited impacted communities throughout this year, I have met personally with residents who were forced to flee their homes and with local leaders, volunteers, and firefighter crews. Their incredible resilience and willingness to serve their neighbors in such a difficult time embodies the best of what it means to be New Mexican. That's why I have done everything in my power to have their back. PHOTO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich visits with families impacted by the Hermit's Peak-Calf Canyon Fire at the Glorieta Red Cross shelter, May 7, 2022. The federal government has a responsibility to provide compensation and assistance to New Mexicans whose lives and livelihoods have been upended by this fire. Senator Luján and I talked to every single senator who would listen to make sure we would have the votes to deliver the resources that New Mexicans need to rebuild in the aftermath of the worst fire in our state's history. I know that passing the funding in the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act is just the start of this process. I also worked hard to increase pay, create new mental wellness and health supports, and establish a new wildland fire management job series for federal firefighters. This new support for our firefighter workforce was made possible by provisions that I secured in the recently passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The Infrastructure Law also included major support for critical forest management and restoration programs that help to reduce severe wildfires and protect watersheds in New Mexico. I remain determined to leave no stone unturned in making sure that we restore the health of our forests and watersheds and that New Mexico families and communities are made whole. Protecting health care services for veterans I am honored to serve a state with a proud tradition of service and one of the highest rates of military volunteerism in the nation. Through my current leadership role on the Appropriations Subcommittee that oversees the VA's funding, I am committed to ensuring that all of our veterans and their families receive the full education, housing, and health care benefits that they have earned through their service. This year, I helped to pass the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act to provide long overdue recognition, screening, and treatment from the VA for toxic exposure related conditions. Finally, so many generations of veterans who have been exposed to toxins through their service will receive the VA health care and benefits that they have long deserved. PHOTO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich and U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough visit with veterans at the Gallup CBOC, June 28, 2022. I also fought like hell every step of the way to make sure that the VA's community-based outpatient clinics--or CBOCs for short--in Gallup, Las Vegas, Española, and Raton remain open. I have worked closely with these communities to open and support their CBOCs, which are an example of what the VA has been doing right to meet the needs of rural veterans. After I invited U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough to join me in New Mexico to tour VA facilities, he saw firsthand how crucially important it is to maintain the health care services at our CBOCs. By putting a halt to the AIR Commission process that threatened their future, I made sure that these clinics that provide quality health care to New Mexico veterans are no longer in jeopardy of closing. Investing in infrastructure and innovation For decades, New Mexico has been held back by a systemic lack of investment in our infrastructure. Over this past year, I have been focused on steering the once-in-a-generation federal resources from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to New Mexico to rebuild our roads, bridges and rails, expand access to clean drinking water, ensure more New Mexicans have access to high-speed internet, and revitalize communities that have too often been left behind. PHOTO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich visits Berino to highlight how the Infrastructure Law will deliver critical funding for water and sewer improvements, August 16, 2022. The Infrastructure Law is already delivering $1.1 billion to rebuild New Mexico's roads and bridges, nearly $400 million to improve our public transit systems, nearly $150 million to help Tribes build high-speed internet infrastructure, $355 million to repair water and sewer systems, $24 million to improve airports all around New Mexico, $38 million over the next five years to build an electric vehicle charging network, $160 million to support the completion of the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System pipeline, nearly $123 million for the Navajo-Gallup Water Project, $46 million for capping orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaiming abandoned mine lands. On top of all this, I was also proud to play a role in passing the CHIPS and Science Act, bipartisan legislation that strengthens our country's commitment to science and technological innovation. To maintain our competitiveness on in the global economy, it is critical for the United States to maintain its moral and ethical leadership on scientific research and technological capabilities. The investments in the CHIPS Act will empower New Mexico's world-class research universities, national labs, and high-tech and advanced manufacturing industries to keep growing in emerging fields like quantum computing and microelectronics. Bipartisan breakthrough on community safety Until we all feel safe in our homes, schools, and neighborhoods, I will keep working to secure funding for effective, community-driven solutions that address the root causes of violent crime. Earlier this year, I announced more than $22 million in federal investments from the U.S. Department of Justice that will support community solutions to prevent crime, increase public safety, provide services for victims of violent crime, and enhance Tribal law enforcement and support services for survivors. PHOTO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich joins (from left) former U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, and U.S. Senator Mark Kelly at the White House Commemoration of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, July 11, 2022. I was also proud to be a part of the bipartisan group of senators who came together in the wake of tragedies in Uvalde, Texas and Buffalo, New York to find a meaningful path forward to pass the most significant law in nearly three decades to reduce gun violence and invest in public safety. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act will increase access to mental health care, invest in proven school and community-based violence prevention programs, and keep guns out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves and their communities. During negotiations, I worked especially hard on provisions that will crack down on straw purchasing and trafficking of guns. These provisions will directly cut down on gun violence at home-particularly in New Mexico's southern border communities-and internationally. I am grateful to all of the New Mexicans who have raised their voices to demand action to reduce gun violence and protect our kids. I am confident that this new law will make a real difference in reducing gun violence-a difference that will be measured in lives saved. Recovering the health of our land, water, and wildlife Restoring the health of our land, water, and wildlife is essential to passing on our way of life in New Mexico to our kids and future generations. That's why I have been hard at work advancing my landmark bipartisan conservation bill, the Recovering America's Wildlife Act (RAWA), which will invest more than $1.3 billion each year in proactive, on-the-ground conservation work led State and Tribal wildlife agencies to support the long-term health of fish and wildlife and their habitat. PHOTO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, Tribal leaders, and Trust for Public Land celebrate the expansion of the Marquez Wildlife Area in New Mexico, June 29, 2022. I am continuing my efforts to improve and maintain public access to New Mexico's incredible public lands. This year, I joined many New Mexicans in celebrating the monumental new addition to the Marquez Wildlife Area. The high mesas, dramatic volcanic cones, and wide-open valleys of the historic L Bar Ranch property are the single greatest addition to protected public land in New Mexico in a generation, and they will make the Marquez Wildlife Area our state's largest state-owned recreation property. I also introduced legislation to establish Cerro de la Olla Wilderness within the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument, the Pecos Watershed Protection Act and Buffalo Tract Protection Act to prevent mining operations from harming treasured landscapes and watersheds, and the M.H. Dutch Salmon Greater Gila Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to provide southwestern New Mexico's greater Gila River watershed with our nation's highest form of protection and stewardship. I also welcomed the landmark ruling by the New Mexico Supreme Court that reaffirmed the constitutional rights of all New Mexicans to access our public waters. This was an enormous victory for people who care about our history, our culture, and our natural resources. Public waters will remain public for hunting, fishing, and recreation. Safeguarding Tribal patrimony For years, I have been working in close partnership with Pueblos in New Mexico, the Jicarilla and Mescalero Apache Nations, the Navajo Nation, and Tribes across Indian Country to halt the trade of culturally significant items and repatriate stolen pieces that were trafficked illegally to their rightful owners. After years of building up Tribal and bipartisan support, Congress passed my bipartisan legislation, the Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony (STOP) Act. VIDEO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) speaks on the Senate floor urging unanimous consent for his bipartisan Safeguard Tribal Objects of Patrimony (STOP) Act, November 29, 2022. This issue first came to my attention back in 2016 when then Pueblo of Acoma Governor Kurt Riley informed me that the Acoma shield, a sacred ceremonial object that had been stolen had been discovered on a list of Tribal artifacts up for bid at an art auction house in Paris, France. I immediately contacted then Secretary of State John Kerry and urged the U.S. State Department to take all possible action to help repatriate the shield and other stolen cultural items. Thankfully, in the case of the Acoma shield, intense public outcry and diplomatic pressure were enough to prevent the illegal sale of cultural patrimony and return the item to the Pueblo. But it never should have come to that. That's why I worked so hard to pass the STOP Act. Now that the President has signed it, I look forward to working with the Biden Administration to implement this new law and prevent future illegal exporting and trafficking of sacred Native American items. Defending our democracy and protecting civil rights We entered dangerous territory when six radical-conservative Supreme Court Justices gave Republican lawmakers final say in the reproductive and health care decisions of every woman in America. The overturning of Roe v. Wade came on top of a number of radical decisions from the Court in recent years, which include attacks on Tribal sovereignty and rollbacks of campaign finance laws and voting rights protections. It's clear that we must protect our rights from decisions made by the radical and out of touch MAGA majority on the Supreme Court. That's why I worked to pass legislation providing certainty that the marriages of same-sex and interracial couples will not only be protected, but also given equal recognition across our nation. No American should have their rights and freedoms threatened because of who they are and whom they love. PHOTO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich stands with Senate Democrats at the U.S. Capitol in solidarity with women's right to make their own health care decisions, May 3, 2022. We can never allow threats to our democracy to foment violence like what we witnessed in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. That's why senators from both parties came together at the end of this year to pass bipartisan reforms to the Electoral Count Act and stronger security measures for nonpartisan local elections workers. Unfortunately, every single Senate Republican has chosen to use the filibuster to block us from even beginning debate on broader voting rights and campaign finance legislation and bills to codify Roe v. Wade . But I refuse to give up on preserving our hard-won and constitutional right to vote in free and fair elections and guaranteeing the right to privacy in health care decisions for every single American. Serving New Mexicans My office also continues to help constituents in New Mexico on a one-on-one basis when they are having trouble with federal agencies, including keeping our promise to our veterans and service members. Last year alone, my staff held Mobile Office Hours events in communities throughout the state and processed nearly 2,500 individual cases that resulted in over $8.1 million recovered for New Mexicans. If you or your family needs help, I encourage you can contact my office by calling (505) 346-6601 or by visiting the Helping You section on my website. I hope you and your loved ones are able to enjoy a peaceful and restful holiday season.

314," Nightmare Before Christmas 117th Congress, 2nd Session | December 22nd, 2022 As Americans make their last-minute shopping trips and prepare for holiday travel before spending time with their loved ones this Christmas, Congress is attempting to quickly and quietly pass a $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill. Democrats - and far too many Republicans - in both the House and Senate are gearing up to ram through this pricey package, as they hope the country is too consumed with Christmas to notice. It's shameful - and you deserve to know the full truth. After kicking the can of government funding down the road for months, Democrats finally unveiled their spending bill as Americans were sound asleep. Under the cover of darkness, a whopping 4,155-page, $1.7 trillion omnibus bill was released around 1:30 AM on Tuesday. Lawmakers are now expected to vote on this massive spending spree in a matter of hours - leaving little to no time to fully read or debate the legislation. We all know Washington loves wasteful spending, so what pork did lawmakers tuck into this taxpayer-funded nightmare? To no one's surprise, over 7,000 earmarks made their way into the bill. Here are a few egregious examples: $3.6 million for a ""Michelle Obama Trail"" in Georgia $3 million for an LGBTQ+ museum in New York City $1.2 million in services for DACA recipients in San Diego $791,200 for ""equitable energy resilience and electric vehicle infrastructure"" in Sonoma, California $956,000 for ""The Equity Incubator"" for universities in Maryland Additionally, the costly bill spends loads of taxpayer dollars on border security - but it's not what you think. Over $400 million is appropriated to foreign nations, including Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia, and Oman, for ""enhanced border security."" An additional $45 billion, yes billion, in Ukraine aid is also included - which would bring total U.S. spending on Ukraine to more than $100 billion. Democrats graciously threw in a mere $400 million boost to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, but prohibits these funds from being used to ""acquire, maintain, or extend border security technology and capabilities."" This is clearly another America Last policy. Beyond the reckless spending and radical policies, there is also no precedent for this nonsense. Never before has the outgoing House majority passed an omnibus spending bill during the lame duck session following an election. The best - and most responsible - path forward is for Republicans to reject Democrats' $1.7 trillion appropriations package, pass a short-term spending bill to extend government funding into 2023, and allow the newly-elected Congress to make spending decisions in the new year - as voters intended. While House Republicans are currently in the minority and don't have the votes to kill Democrats' spending bill, Senate Republicans had the power to stop this insanity - yet 18 voted for this nightmare before Christmas. Prior to the Senate vote, I proudly joined a dozen of my House Republican colleagues in calling on every single Republican Senator to do their job by opposing the $1.7 trillion monstrosity of a bill. Make no mistake, we will not forget those that failed in their duty to stand up for America, and we are fully prepared to thwart the legislative priorities of any Republican Senator that helped drag this spending bill across the finish line. This entire fiasco perfectly embodies the Swamp: always working for themselves, but never for the American people. I will continue to do everything in my power to fight this disastrous funding bill and oppose the status quo in Washington that leaves Americans in the dark, yet left to pay the bill. We must restore sanity and accountability in Congress when House Republicans retake the majority on January 3rd. 117th Congress, 2nd Session | December 22nd, 2022 As Americans make their last-minute shopping trips and prepare for holiday travel before spending time with their loved ones this Christmas, Congress is attempting to quickly and quietly pass a $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill.

Take Survey A Year of Service - A Year of Results As 2022 comes to a close, I'd like to reflect on my second year of serving you in Congress. First and foremost, thank you for your prayers, kind words, and encouragement. Many of you have either called my office or reached out over social media to offer support during my first term in Washington, and these thoughtful gestures have meant the world to me as I continue the good fight on behalf of the Ninth District. In D.C., I worked with my Republican colleagues to hold the Biden Administration's feet to the fire for inflicting numerous crises on our country, including soaring inflation, rampant crime, and a wide-open southern border. I also proudly advanced conservative policies on behalf of the Ninth that put Americans first. In fact, over the past year, I introduced seven more pieces of legislation and five resolutions - ranging from protecting the unborn and defending our Second Amendment freedoms to blocking Biden's harmful economic policies and eliminating government-by-proxy censorship. Additionally, I led numerous letters to fight for Northeast Georgian farmers and growers, call out the Biden Administration's disastrous agenda, and demand answers and accountability for the American people. Down in the District, I held productive constituent meetings and made more than 130 site visits across the beautiful Ninth. I always enjoy learning more about the operations of our impressive manufacturing plants, such as Kubota, discussing ways I can help our agriculture community, including Jaemor Farms and Pilgrim's Pride, visiting patriotic Rangers at Camp Merrill, and meeting with students and educators throughout schools and universities in the District, such as the University of North Georgia and Toccoa Falls College. I've truly enjoyed building relationships with various industry and local leaders in order to discover ways that we can work together to best serve Northeast Georgians. From the overturning of Roe v. Wade to the continuation of Democrats' out-of-control spending, this year was filled with both victorious wins and partisan challenges. Through it all, I'm honored to represent our shared values and defend our constitutional freedoms in Washington. I look forward to advancing conservative policies, fostering fiscal responsibility, and protecting our precious liberties under a House Republican majority in the new year. New Year, New Office! I'm excited to share that I've officially moved into my new Washington office for the 118th Congress! My D.C. team and I will remain in the Cannon House Office Building, where we will continue diligently fighting for Northeast Georgians. Our updated mailing address is: 445 Cannon House Office Building Washington, D.C. 20515. I always love to hear from the Ninth. Please never hesitate to contact my Gainesville District Office if you or a loved one need assistance with a federal agency, or my D.C. Office if you have questions, comments, or concerns about my work on your behalf in Washington.

Clyde Presses Biden on Border Plan As you may know, President Biden was fully prepared to deliver a heightened border crisis to the American people just in time for Christmas. Issued by President Trump, Title 42 allows the immediate expulsion of illegal aliens in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at the southern border. This policy was set to expire on December 21st, raising serious concerns about the subsequent influx of illegal migrants. Thankfully, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts granted a stay pending further order, temporarily blocking the termination of Title 42. To no one's surprise, the Biden Administration requested the Supreme Court to allow Title 42 to end but requested that Roberts' administrative stay remain until December 27th - after the holiday weekend and as Biden enjoys a tropical vacation. In response, I led 30 of my colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden demanding a comprehensive plan detailing how the Biden Administration will handle a worsening border crisis if Title 42 expires. Given the Biden Administration's track record of abdicating its responsibilities and enabling mayhem through its open border agenda, I don't believe the President is prepared for the possible end of Title 42 or has any intention of improving the situation at the southern border anytime soon. I look forward to fully investigating this matter, holding the Biden Administration accountable, and advancing policies to secure the border under a House Republican majority next year.

315," Message from Congressman Brad Schneider ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ Message from Representative Brad Schneider 10th News: Wishing You a Joyous Holiday It's hard to believe 2022 is coming to an end. Our office will be closed next week for the holidays, so this is my final newsletter of the year. That is assuming Congress passes legislation funding the government this week. Before reflecting on the year, I want to wish everyone happy holidays. To those celebrating Hanukkah, may the spirit of the Festival of Lights bring warmth and happiness to you and your loved ones, and may the ideals of rededication offer inspiration. To my friends celebrating Christmas this coming weekend, may your lights all shine bright, joined by family and friends, and may the season bring love, hope, and joy to the world. And to all celebrating Kwanzaa next week, wishing you a bright and meaningful holiday. Also, let us, please, keep in our hearts all those serving our nation far from home, including our military, diplomats, aid, and development workers. And our first responders and front-line workers answering the call to service here during this holiday season. Because of their sacrifices and time away from family, we all are more secure in our homes and communities. REFLECTIONS ON 2022 Remembering Highland Park Without question, the watershed moment of the past year was the Highland Park Independence Day Parade shooting. Seven wonderful people were murdered: Katherine Goldstein, Irina and Kevin McCarthy, Stephen Straus, Jackie Sundheim, Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, and Eduardo Uvaldo. More than 40 people were wounded, and our entire community was traumatized. It was the 308th mass shooting in the US in a year that has seen more than 600 mass shootings. I will never forget the shock of that day, nor the grief of our community. But I will also forever remember the strength of Highland Park and the outpouring of support and love that came from neighboring communities and across the country. I am thankful to the countless people who have drawn strength from tragedy to step up and call for action at all levels of government to keep our children and our communities safe from gun violence. I will continue to work to reduce gun violence of all types in all communities, including advancing the assault weapons ban that I helped pass in the House last July. A Most Productive Congress Despite a very narrow Democratic majority, the 117th Congress passed some remarkable legislation giving President Biden, and the country, some landmark wins. Last spring, Congress passed legislation funding all 10 of our district's 2022 Community Project Funding Requests, addressing local needs such as mental health, flooding, food insecurity, and economic development The spring funding bill also included my Israel Relations Normalization Act supporting the historic Abraham Accords between United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, In June, we passed the Chips & Science Act bringing critical semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States and investing to ensure U.S. technological leadership well into the future We also passed the PACT Act supporting our veterans and in particular providing health care to individuals exposed to toxic burn pits. June wrapped up with House passage of the Respect for Marriage Act, protecting marriage equality for all Americans. Earlier this month, the bill passed the Senate and was signed into law by President Biden. In July, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act to lower the cost of prescription drugs, support American manufacturing and strengthen our supply chains. This bill also includes the single greatest investment yet in tackling climate change, working to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 40% by 2030. I was particularly proud that this bill included my legislation supporting the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) towards cutting GHG emissions for air travel by more than 50% Finally, this week Congress will pass an ""Omnibus"" spending bill to fund the government for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2023. I am pleased that all 15 of the 10th District 2023 Community Project Funding Requests are included, as was my bill to improve retirement security and a provision supporting telemedicine. The Omnibus also includes the Innovative Technologies Impacted by COVID-19 Act, bipartisan legislation I introduced with Rep. LaHood to provide support for innovative medical devices that treat critical diseases, such as cancer. Other Highlights Here at home, the year was chock full of wonderful memories. We hosted 13 Congress on Your Corner Town Halls across the district. I continued my Brad at Your Business visits to a wide variety of companies, such as HP Tuners in Buffalo Grove, Bell Flavors and Fragrances in Northbrook, and Hydaforce in Vernon Hills. My STEAM Scholars program visited Ravinia Music Festival in Highland Park, Yaskawa America in Buffalo Grove, and Abbott Labs in North Chicago. And we had another banner year with Brad's Book Worms, celebrating young readers. I was honored to attend many events and celebrations throughout the year in virtually every corner of the district. From speaking at Estonia House in Riverwoods to attending Fox Lake Mayor Donny Schmit's annual lasagna luncheon (he makes the lasagna himself), I loved every opportunity to meet with the people I am privileged and proud to represent. And, of course, I always enjoy my annual ""Tour of the 10th"" bike ride. Our district is also home to Naval Station Great Lakes (NSGL) and the Navy's Recruit Training Command. (Did you know that every enlisted sailor comes to NSGL for basic training?) Last April, I was the Reviewing Officer at a recruit graduation ceremony. Education is a top priority for me, so I was excited when five of our local schools received the National Blue-Ribbon Award-Daniel Wright Junior High School, Deerfield High School, Wood Oaks Junior High School, and Westmoor and Wescott Elementary Schools. I am also a big fan of summer camp (being a camp counselor is still one of my best work experiences). So, one of my favorite summer traditions is visiting Camp Duncan and Camp Independence in Volo, both operated by the YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago. Another one of my always favorite opportunities is welcoming home new American citizens at a special naturalization ceremony hosted by the Chicago Botanic Garden. It is an incomparable experience to see these people take the oath of citizenship and then celebrate their achievements with family and friends. This year I was joined by Reps. Schakowsky and Casten for a most remarkable experience. Finally, I want to thank the people of the 10th district for your phone calls, letters, and in-person meetings, sharing your thoughts on moving this great country forward. Thanks to your input, I can confidently represent your interests and needs in Washington. I look forward to working together to strengthen our communities and nation. I wish you and your loved ones a blessed and plentiful holiday and a new year! Please keep reading for more information about what is happening in Washington and at home. THIS WEEK AROUND THE DISTRICT Abuelitas/Abuelitos Program - Uniting Families in the 10th District Last week I was proud to announce that I am working with former Senator Kirk to restart a program he initiated when he represented the Tenth District. Our plan is to help Mexican American families in our communities navigate the complex and often expensive visa application process so they can reconnect with their loved ones from Mexico, many of whom they haven't seen in ten to twenty years. My grandparents were profound influences in my life. The love and support we receive from our family members are unlike anything else-they help us grow, support our dreams and aspirations, and teach us the many traditions we hold special in our cultures. Family is a value we can all support, regardless of political affiliation. I hope that my work with former Senator Kirk will make families in the tenth district even stronger. You can read the full article detailing this announcement of this project here . Visiting Bernard Weinger JCC Early Childhood Center in Northbrook I started this week with a tour of the JCC Chicago - Bernard Weinger JCC Early Childhood Center in Northbrook. We had a great conversation about the importance of investing in early childhood education for all kids. Thank you to JUF Board Chairman David Golder and President of JCC Chicago Annie Goodman for Monday's invitation. Cancer Moon Shot David Davydov of Indian Creek came to our office to share information about his work with ALK Positive and his efforts to defeat not only this specific form of lung cancer but all cancers. I very much appreciate his passion and the work that he is doing. David, like so many other issue advocates who visit me either in our Lincolnshire or Washington office, help me better understand the priorities of our district and how Congress can work to make a positive impact. Meeting the Kindness Crew at Hawthorn North Middle School I had a great time visiting Hawthorn North Middle School in Vernon Hills. I met with members of the Kindness Crew and learned about their many ideas and great work making their school a more special place. Brushwood Center - Connecting Nature with Art, Education and Health Equity Thank you to the Brushwood Center at Ryerson Woods team for spending time with me to talk about the remarkable work being done at the center and in our community. Brushwood does an excellent job connecting Lake County residents, including veterans and underserved populations, to nature. Holiday Card Design Contest Winner Last week I announced that Anvi Gupta, a 1st grader at Oak Grove Elementary School in Libertyville, designed the winning artwork for my 2022 office holiday card. As a bookworm myself, I am thrilled that 'home for the holidays' still means picking up a book by the fire for Tenth District first graders. May Anvi's art help bring health, happiness, and peace this holiday season. US Navy League Holiday Celebration Over the weekend, I attended the US Navy League's annual holiday party at the National Museum of the American Sailor. The museum is a hidden treasure of our district. On this visit, it was a special treat to tour of the museum's vault filled with old uniforms, equipment, and other interesting objects used throughout our navy's history. If you're looking for a fun and engaging indoor activity this winter, I highly suggest this great museum! Brunch With Santa in Waukegan I also stopped in Waukegan for First United Methodist Church's brunch with Santa on Saturday. It was great to share the holiday cheer with parents and their children as they decorated cookies and met with Santa. A big thank you to Avia Duncan for putting this event together. Supporting the Boys and Girls Club I also stopped by the Boys and Girls Club of Lake County in Waukegan in for their holiday celebration. A big thank you to Rayon ""Ray Ray"" Edwards for putting together this celebration. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON Funding the Government for Fiscal Year 2023 The big news is the passage of the Omnibus bill. The package includes funding for 10th District projects, funding to protect children enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP, and language to reform the Electoral Count Act. All 15 of the Tenth District's Community Project Funding (CPF) submissions were included in the legislation, as were bills I introduced to improve retirement security and a provision supporting telemedicine. The Omnibus also includes my bill, the Innovative Technologies Impacted by COVID-19 Act, bipartisan legislation he introduced with Rep. LaHood that provides support for innovative medical devices that treat critical diseases, such as cancer. Mandatory Audits of All Presidents' Tax Returns From our founding, the United States was established to be a nation ruled by laws, not kings. No one is above the law, including and especially the President. Americans need to be able to trust that the President pays taxes like anyone else. That is why in 1977, the IRS implemented a policy of mandatory examination (audit) of Presidential tax returns. Since 1977, independent of the audit process, every President released their annual returns to the public. President Trump declined to do so when he assumed office in 2017. Absent public access to the President's returns, the IRS Mandatory Audit became more significant to give American certainty that the President was adhering to the law. The Ways and Means Committee's investigation into the IRS Mandatory Audit policy demonstrated that the policy was, at the best dormant and, at the worst, completely ignored. It was clear that legislation is necessary to ensure the IRS completes timely and complete mandatory review of the President's tax return. The Committee deliberated on the report of the investigation and ultimately voted to release the report with supporting documentation-including several years of President's Trumps returns- to the full House The Teachers are Leaders Act Last week I introduced the Teachers Are Leaders Act (H.R. 9498) to expand professional development and leadership growth opportunities for teachers. The federal Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) grant currently connects local schools with nearby colleges and universities to create professional development programs for new teachers. However, there need to be more opportunities for established teachers. The Teachers Are Leaders Act would expand TQP grants by making ""teacher leader"" programs focused on professional development for established teachers eligible for funding.

IN CLOSING - Again, wishing everyone a joyful holiday and a new year filled only with health, happiness, and peace. I want to close out this week's newsletter with excellent news and a big thank you to everyone who participated in this year's ""Holiday Cards for Heroes"" program. We collected more than 965-holiday cards for the brave men and women serving our nation overseas. That's an impressive new record. These handwritten cards will undoubtedly bring smiles and holiday joy to our nation's heroes. I am proud that we all came together to make this year a success. I am eager to have an equally successful program next year! Stay strong, stay safe, stay healthy. Sincerely, Bradley S. Schneider Member of Congress Washington D.C.

316," Coach Tuberville here... As we close out this year, our office has reflected on the work we've done on behalf of the great state of Alabama. In our second year serving the state, we focused on five main priorities: ONE: bolstering our national security and supporting our troops, TWO: empowering veterans, THREE: supporting rural communities and our agricultural producers, FOUR : countering Chinese aggression, and FIVE: advocating for students. On behalf of my wife Suzanne and all of the Tubervilles, we wish you a very merry Christmas and happy holidays. As we come together with our families for the holidays, I hope you join us in saying a special prayer for our hard-working men and women in uniform who are defending our freedoms around the world. Our military spends time away from their families so we can safely be with ours. God bless, Remaining Responsive: Senator Tuberville's team held more than 2,500 constituent meetings across the state, visited all 67 counties every quarter, and secured more than $176 million in federal grants for constituents. Additionally, Senator Tuberville's team held satellite office hours in rural communities across Alabama every quarter to assist constituents who live far from a permanent office location. The team also hosted two satellite offices specifically focused on veterans' casework and the federal grants processes. Keeping Constituents Informed: Senator Tuberville reached more than 2,512,380 homes in Alabama with print, television, and radio interviews in the state. Preserving Alabama's History: Senator Tuberville introduced legislation to reauthorize the Muscle Shoals National Heritage Area, and to establish the Alabama Black Belt National Heritage Area. National Heritage Areas (NHAs) are partnerships between the National Park Service, states, and local entities to protect and support conservation and public access. Listening to Constituents: In response to hearing from many constituents about the problems caused by annual time changes, Senator Tuberville championed the Sunshine Protection Act to make Daylight Saving Time permanent, which passed the U.S. Senate earlier this year with unanimous support. Prioritizing Military Needs in the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (FY23 NDAA): Senator Tuberville focused on five priorities while crafting this year's NDAA: Risk Taking: Senator Tuberville continues to support defense leaders who push their departments to take strategic and calculated risks. Lethality: Much of the DoD budget is concentrated in areas that do not contribute directly to the defense of the nation. Senator Tuberville has pushed the department to be a ""killing machine,"" and believes that functions that do not enhance the lethality of the force should be dropped or moved to other areas of the government. Securing the Indo-Pacific: With the economic and military rise of China, the United States faces its first peer adversary since the 19th century. Senator Tuberville believes the United States must focus on securing our territory and interests in the region. Space: Senator Tuberville believes the United States has fallen behind in space and cyber warfare and our nation needs to catch up. Whether it's in space exploration, missile defense, hypersonic missiles, GPS, or artificial intelligence, Senator Tuberville supports provisions that promote American dominance in this domain. Capacity: Senator Tuberville is concerned our strategic stockpiles are low, our prime contractors are dwindling, our shipyards are drying up, our critical resources are being offshored, and our manufacturing base is weak. The United States must foster the resource and industrial capacity to sustain our military might. Securing Wins for Alabama's Installations: In Senator Tuberville's second year on the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), he secured significant wins for Alabama's defense community. The NDAA authorizes funding for: a new gate inspection area at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, the extension of a pilot program that allows service members who work at Maxwell - but live off-base - to send their children to the base school, additional resources - including funding for a physics lab and the Missile and Space Intelligence Center - for Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, the construction of a new FBI warehouse at Redstone Arsenal, additional support for the Security Services Training Facility at the Sumpter-Smith Air National Guard Base in Birmingham, and additional resources to bolster America's missile defense stockpile, expanding the number of Alabamians supporting our military's lethal force. Streamlining Requests: Senator Tuberville developed a new, streamlined submission process to make it easier to submit NDAA requests. Senator Tuberville and his team participated in more than 60 hearings and held more than 365 meetings with government officials, industry leaders, think tanks, and key stakeholders in preparation for the FY23 NDAA markups. Boosting Military Spending: Senator Tuberville pushed to increase the overall military budget by $45 billion above President Biden's proposal. This increase will fund improvements for Alabama's military bases and additional weapons research, development, and production in Alabama. Fighting for SPACECOM's Relocation to Huntsville: Senator Tuberville fought against attempts to derail the U.S. Air Force's (USAF) decision to permanently locate U.S. Space Command at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville during Senate Armed Services Committee hearings, and urged his colleagues to support the USAF's decision. Investing in Cybersecurity: Senator Tuberville helped reauthorize the National Computer Forensics Institute in Hoover, AL, and provided resources to expand its capability to train federal law enforcement officers. This institute is the only of its kind in the nation and provides innovative training for law enforcement officials on how to combat cybercrimes. Hear Senator Tuberville's statement on this year's NDAA and its wins for Alabama below: Making Targeted but Meaningful Changes: Senator Tuberville worked to identify targeted changes that would improve how the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs delivers care and benefits to veterans and their dependents. Those changes - no matter how small they may seem - positively affect the lives of our veterans and their families. For example, after learning of a seemingly insignificant, but consequential, error on U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S. Department of Defense forms that makes it difficult for dependents to receive Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, Senator Tuberville introduced legislation to correct this error. This bill is headed to the President's desk to be signed into law. Supporting Families of the Fallen Act: Senator Tuberville's first piece of standalone legislation, the Supporting Families of the Fallen Act , became law passing both chambers of Congress without opposition. The bill provided the first increase of maximum coverage amounts under the U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance and Veterans' Group Life Insurance since 2005 - updating the amount from $400,000 to $500,000. Improving Health Care Access: Senator Tuberville advocated for veterans' access to primary, specialty, and mental health care outside of their respective Veteran Integrated Service Networks and non-Veterans Affairs facilities to cut wait times for those who have served. He also pushed the DoD for answers regarding its contract change with Express Scripts that will limit TRICARE beneficiaries' ability to maintain access to local pharmacies. Seeing the Crisis Firsthand: In October, Senator Tuberville visited the Del Rio sector of our southern border in Eagle Pass, Texas where he met with law enforcement officials to get a closer look at the crisis at our southern border and better understand what resources are needed to secure our border. Pushing Back on Attempts to Dismantle Our Legal Immigration Process: Senator Tuberville joined efforts to overturn the Biden administration's disastrous rule to allow illegal immigrants at the southern border to be granted expedited asylum status. Protecting American Farmland: Senator Tuberville introduced legislation to prohibit members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from purchasing land in the United States. Chinese investors' holdings of U.S. agricultural land has surged in the last decade. These investments can provide the CCP with access to sensitive information critical to America's national security and undue leverage over U.S. supply chains. Alabama has the third-highest amount of foreign-owned agricultural land in the United States. Curbing U.S. Investment in China: Senator Tuberville continued pushing back against investment of Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) funds in Chinese companies by placing a hold on nominees to the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board until the nominees provided clarification regarding foreign investment policies. His efforts forced the nominees to commit to opposing TSP investment in China. Looking Out for U.S. Investors: Senator Tuberville led the call for an investigation into Webull Financial, LLC and Moomoo, Inc. - two Chinese-owned stock trading apps operating in the United States that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Both apps are widely used by American investors and freely collect and store sensitive information about users, including Social Security numbers, mailing addresses, and sensitive financial account data. Senator Tuberville also pushed for President Biden to ban Russian companies from the U.S. financial system to ensure American investors are not inadvertently funding Russia's war against Ukraine. Listening to Needs of Agriculture Community: Senator Tuberville began listening sessions and roundtables with farmers and industry leaders in advance of the upcoming Farm Bill reauthorization. In considering this legislative process, which will stretch into next year, Senator Tuberville has chosen to take a listen-first approach in order to directly advocate for the interests of Alabama's farmers. Standing up for Agricultural Producers: Senator Tuberville pushed back against the SEC's proposed rule that would place unworkable climate disclosure regulations on farmers, ranchers, and agriculture producers, and urged the United States Trade Representative's chief agricultural negotiator to seek trade agreements in support of America's agricultural producers. Additionally, Senator Tuberville encouraged the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to maintain an exemption of air emission from animal waste at farms under the Emergency Planning Community Right-to-Know Act. Preserving Red Snapper Season in the Gulf: Senator Tuberville pushed back against the U.S. Department of Commerce's proposed rule requiring all state fisheries data to be converted into a single, less accurate federal system, which would result in decreased overfishing limits for red snappers. Cutting Red Tape for Local Governments: Senator Tuberville introduced the Simplifying Grants Act to make the federal grant process easier for local governments and bridge discrepancies between funding awarded to larger local governments and smaller local governments who may not have the resources to complete complex applications. Sounding the Alarm About Biden Administration's Title IX Proposal: As a former coach, Senator Tuberville is passionate about preserving a level playing field for male and female athletes. He fought against the U.S. Department of Education's proposed rule to force institutions to allow biological males to participate in women's sports and urged Secretary Cardona to extend the public comment period for the proposal. Senator Tuberville also led his colleagues in recognizing the positive impacts of Title IX on women's sports in honor of the 50th Anniversary of its enaction. Protecting Student Athletes and Scholastic Competition: As a former college football coach, Senator Tuberville wants to ensure student athletes are protected and college sports are preserved following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing student athletes receiving compensation for the use of their name, image, and likeness (NIL). Senator Tuberville teamed up with Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) to solicit feedback from stakeholders that will be used to draft bipartisan NIL legislation next year. Protecting School Choice: Senator Tuberville urged the U.S. Department of Education to reconsider proposed rules that would impose severe limitations on the bipartisan federal Charter Schools Program (CSP) and limit school options for parents and children. Additionally, he helped introduce a resolution in support of National School Choice Week. Advocating for Mental Health: Senator Tuberville advocated for students' mental health during U.S. Senate Help, Education, Labor, and Pensions, Committee hearings while highlighting the role that career readiness has in mental health. He is committed to ensuring students feel empowered for their next career steps, whether it be enlisting in the military, completing a technical training program, or attending a four-year university. Accounting for COVID-Relief Funding: Senator Tuberville pressed President Biden and other senior officials for detailed accounts of how the billions of dollars in COVID-19 relief funds were spent. He requested the Health and Human Services inspector general conduct an audit of the department's $10 billion COVID-vaccine public education campaign and joined the probe into canceled contracts for ambiguous COVID-19 relief efforts. Additionally, Senator Tuberville pushed to require any new World Health Organization convention agreement to be approved by the U.S. Senate. Calling Out Hypocritical Leftist Climate Policies: Senator Tuberville blasted the Biden administration's war on fossil fuels that is creating a surge in energy prices for American families. He also introduced legislation to restore American energy production and decrease reliance on foreign energy sources. Senator Tuberville urged U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo to quickly issue permits required to bring additional production online from existing offshore federal oil and gas leases. Stopping Taxpayer-Subsidized Abortions: Senator Tuberville uncovered the DoD's plan to pay for time off, travel, and other related expenses for service members and their dependents seeking an abortion. The Senator pressed U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin for clarification on the department's plans to implement a policy that subsidizes abortions using federal taxpayer dollars and pledged to place a hold on future DoD civilian and general/flag officer nominations if the DoD implements this policy. Standing up for Financial Freedom: Senator Tuberville championed legislation prohibiting retirement plan financial advisors from investing the savings of Americans based on woke, non-financial environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors.

I offered a brief prayer for Oklahoma and our nation this year through our local newspapers, and I hope you will take a moment to read it and pray through it with me. CLICK HERE to read my prayer for Oklahoma and our nation. Congress's Massive Spending Problem This week, the Senate finally got around to funding the government. Senator Chuck Schumer decided to push through what's called an ""omnibus"" spending bill-this one was more than 4,000 pages and costs almost $2 trillion (with a T)-to fund the government through September 30, 2023. Half of the bill was spending, and half of the bill was new policies that were never debated or even considered on the Senate floor. Not a single Senator read the bill before it passed. I was a strong ""No"" on this bill for many reasons, starting with no ability to know what was in it, billions of dollars of additional deficit spending, billions of new earmark spending, and much more. While there are some areas of the bill that I would not oppose, this bill had too many problems. I could not support its final passage. If we had extended the debate into next year, we could have more transparency and greater ability to limit spending. Oklahomans deserve to know how their hard-earned tax dollars are spent before there is a vote to spend them. CLICK HERE to read more about the spending bill and why I opposed it. Getting the National Defense Bill to the Finish Line in 2022 This year's defense bill, officially known as the Fiscal Year 2023 James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act (or the NDAA), which I supported, passed Congress last week and included a number of important provisions to help Oklahoma's military installations, our service members, veterans, and their families. I worked on issues dealing with veteran housing, religious accommodation requests for our nation's service members who did not want to be forced to get the COVID-19 vaccine, specific upgrades to our military installations, a military pay raise, and more. I made sure our Tulsa VA medical center got the authorization and funding needed to keep going with construction even with Biden's high inflation driving up construction costs. The new Tulsa VA will undoubtedly be a great place to take care of our veterans, but it needs to stay on schedule during construction to meet the needs of our veterans. CLICK HERE to read about all the areas I worked on for Oklahoma's military installations in the defense bill, including ensuring that we now have full funding for the Tulsa VA. In the defense bill, I got the COVID-19 vaccine mandate ended for our service members, and now I'm working for reinstatement and back pay for those service members whose military careers were ended because of Biden's vaccine mandate. CLICK HERE to read more about my bill to reinstate and back pay service members who were discharged due to the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. UPDATE: Illegal Immigration and Title 42 We've known for over a year that the Biden Administration would end the pandemic-related Title 42 authority and allow even more people to illegally cross our southern border. The big question was always: would the Administration even try to stop the flow of migrants into our country? The answer is now a clear ""No."" The Biden Administration is actually encouraging more illegal immigration by giving every person who comes across the border a work permit, sometimes the same day they cross. That tells people who are thinking about coming illegally that they can come to the US, cross our border, and be rewarded. The Administration has also used Border Patrol funding to create systems to help people enter the country faster, rather than deter people from entering the country. They are literally rewarding illegal activity. To give a perspective of how bad the illegal activity at the border has become, the peak year of illegal crossing under President Obama was just over 500,000 people in a year. Under President Biden, our nation has seen over 500,000 illegal crossings in just the past two months, with no plan to stop it or deter the massive increase of drugs coming into our country every day. Yesterday, I asked the Senate to pass my solution, which I actually introduced in April, to keep the temporary Title 42 authority in place until a workable alternative is ready to go-not just something that processes people into the country faster. Unfortunately Democrats blocked my bill on the floor of the Senate. Time will tell how many more people will get moved into the interior of our country faster because the Democrats control the border enforcement and refuse to stop illegal activity when they see it. CLICK HERE to watch my demand for the Senate to pass my Title 42 bill to protect American national security. It is not compassionate to encourage families across the globe to pay the cartels to smuggle them through Mexico. We need border enforcement and a working legal immigration system. Wrapping up 2022 Each year, my team and I work to bring you a wrap-up of some of what we accomplished for Oklahoma during the last year. Oklahomans tell me often that they hear a lot of noise coming out of Washington, DC, but don't ever actually see anything good happening. Here are some of the things we accomplished for all Oklahomans in 2022. CLICK HERE to watch my video wrap-up of some of my and my team's work in 2022 for us. My Work to Stand Up for Our Veterans and Service Members in 2022 CLICK HERE to watch the video. My team and I worked to support hundreds of service members and veterans through our office's casework process by resolving issues at the Department of Defense, with the individual service branches, and others for our Oklahoma veterans. Our nation is better because of our Armed Forces and their families. That's why I'm honored to tell you that my bill to help military spouses start and keep a career with a federal agency passed the Senate this year. My bill gives military spouses the ability to work in fully remote positions for the federal government so they can keep their job, even if they get moved around because of their spouse's mission in our military. This just makes sense for our military spouses, and now it's going to be a reality. CLICK HERE to read more about my bill for military spouses. Another area where we were successful this year was actually something that Oklahomans brought directly to my office. Oklahoma service members, their families, and their rural pharmacists called and emailed me about losing access to their neighborhood and family-owned pharmacies because TRICARE and Express Scripts stopped their contracts with small pharmacies without notice. We immediately took action and directly worked with the Defense Health Agency and Express Scripts to try to get this changed. Now, local pharmacies will have an opportunity to fully consider TRICARE contracts so they can hopefully once again work with service members to fill their prescriptions. CLICK HERE to read more about my work to protect TRICARE benefits for our service members and veterans. I made sure we brought existing federal funds-those available for upkeep of schools on our nation's military bases-to Oklahoma. I personally toured L. Mendel Rivers Elementary School, which serves the children of our US Air Force at Altus Air Force Base, and saw the immediate need to replace the aging facility for the students and workers at the school. I helped ensure the Base's request was heard loud and clear in Washington, DC, and fought for the funding needed to rebuild this school for the kids on Altus Air Force Base. This was yet another area where we saw a need, and we made sure that need was met for our service members and their families, without adding additional national debt. CLICK HERE to read more about how I made sure the school had existing funds to rebuild. My Work to Bring Down High Costs, Including for Rx Drugs, for Our Senior Adults in 2022 CLICK HERE to watch the video. My team and I worked to address issues in Social Security, Medicare, prescription drug prices, and the high prices for everything this year since inflation and high prices hit those on a fixed income the hardest. Inflation has been so high that the Social Security Administration is adding an 8.7 percent cost-of-living adjustment to Social Security benefits beginning in 2023. There are many senior adults in Oklahoma who need extra assistance this year just to make ends meet. If you or someone you know is struggling to pay things like a utility bill, buy food, or pay rent, please call 2-1-1 in Oklahoma to find out about assistance available in our state. My staff and I work with Oklahoma senior adults to make sure they receive their Social Security benefits, Social Security Disability benefits, and Medicare benefits correctly and timely. My team is helping more than 100 Oklahomans right now with their personal issues with the Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, known as CMS, which administers Medicare. If you or someone you know are in need of help, please CLICK HERE . One of the main issues facing senior adults is the cost of and access to quality, affordable health care. After years of me pushing CMS to take action, this year, they made an important change to give our local pharmacies more of the clarity they need to offer drugs at an affordable price by cutting back on the middle man that drives up prescription costs before you buy it at the pharmacy counter. We are slowly unraveling what makes prescription drugs so expensive in our nation. There is still a lot of work to be done, but this is a big win for patients and independent pharmacies. CLICK HERE to read more about my direct push to bring down Rx costs as the pharmacy counter. This year I also got CMS to change their policy on what they consider to be a rural emergency hospital and to make some positive updates to what's called a critical access hospital. Hospitals out in the Oklahoma countryside don't have tons of patients, but in some cases, they are the only hospital for 50 or 60 miles. Now, because of our work on this, many rural hospitals in our state can keep their doors open to provide critical needs for rural communities CLICK HERE to read more about my successful push to help rural hospitals this year. Another way I supported senior adults in Oklahoma this year was by calling out bad economic policies and the Democrats' anti-US-energy agenda that drives up energy prices. If Democrats think everyone in America likes to pay more for groceries, their utility bills, and at the gas pump, they're wrong. I pushed back on the massive spending bills in the last two years that have led in part to our historic levels of inflation. I keep pressing the Biden Administration to let us get back to US energy independence and mine and drill for mineral and energy resources here in the US, instead of buying energy resources from China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. CLICK HERE to watch more about the ways I'm pushing back against the Biden Administration's policies that are taking our nation in the wrong direction. My Work to Call 0ut Biden's Chaos at the Southern Border & Push to Secure the US from Bad Actors around the World in 2022 CLICK HERE to watch the video. Every family wants to have safety and opportunity. That's not a partisan issue. As a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee in the Senate, I spent a great deal of time in 2022 pushing the Biden Administration to secure our border, confront crime, and stand with strength against foreign nations that intend harm for Americans and our economy. On multiple trips to the southern border, I saw first-hand just how much of a toll the border crisis is taking on our nation. Our border patrol agents face the unique challenge of working to secure the border and to stop illegal drugs and crime while the Administration promotes policies that make their job even more difficult. In the past year, over 2 million people have illegally crossed our southern border, and that number is rising. At the end of the year, typically illegal crossings decline, but in the past two months, more than 500,000 people have illegally crossed into our country. To put that into perspective, more people have crossed our border illegally in the past two months than in the highest 12 months of the Obama Administration. The southern border is completely out of control, and it is total chaos. Unfortunately, this Administration does not care. This year, I repeatedly challenged Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on how these failed open-border policies have made America less safe and put more illegal drugs onto our streets, which are destroying our families and communities. I also proposed current legal and future legislative solutions to the border crisis to show that this Administration has options to secure our border; they just choose not to use them. I continue to stand up for keeping Title 42 in place to stop the flood of illegal border crossings and stop more people from attempting to enter our country illegally. CLICK HERE to watch my request on the Senate floor to pass my bill to preserve Title 42 at our southern border. But the border isn't the only security challenge we face as a nation. Overseas, America's adversaries are actively undermining our diplomatic interests and core values. In the Middle East, I led the effort to make Iran answer for their nuclear proliferation and support for terrorism. The Iranian regime is currently murdering peaceful protestors in the streets who just want to live free. I also worked to strengthen our relationship with our greatest ally in the Middle East: Israel. I launched the Abraham Accords Caucus with my colleagues in the Senate to encourage regional partnerships and peace through strength policies. We have made remarkable progress in the past year encouraging old enemies in the Middle East to start trade and tourism. CLICK HERE to read about the Abraham Accords Caucus, which I co-chair. In another part of the globe, the Chinese Communist Party is actively working to repress its people. This year, I called out their genocide against the Uyghur Muslims and defended the authoritarian overreach against the people of Hong Kong and stood up for the rights of the people of Taiwan. I spoke out often for the people of Iran who just want to live free from the oppression of the Iranian regime. Thousands of peaceful protestors have been arrested and hundreds have been killed by the brutal dictators in Iran. The people of Iran want the right to live their faith as they choose. They want the right to speak freely. In short, they want liberty. I have pushed our Administration to impose sanctions on Iranian government leaders, isolate their international diplomats and find ways to stand with the people of Iran. CLICK HERE to watch my remarks on the Senate floor to stand up for the Iranian people and against the terrorist Iranian regime. I also pushed our own Administration to allow a major increase of American natural gas to offset the Russian unjustified assault on Ukraine. Unfortunately, the Administration continues to stand in the way of some of our natural gas exports to Europe to help them during this crisis. Although these risks at home and abroad seem challenging, I am dedicated to working alongside my colleagues to secure our country and stand with our allies. Keeping America safe is critical to our way of life and ensuring that ""We the People"" can prosper for years to come. My Work to Protect Life, Liberty, and Our Families in 2022 CILCK HERE to watch the video. It is not a radical concept that parents are important and should be respected. Parents should decide what's best for their kids. Our freedom to live our values sets us apart as the greatest nation in the world. I spoke out all year for the rights of parents to make decisions for their kids' future and education. CLICK HERE to read more about how I stood up to the powerful unions in Washington, DC, and in support of Oklahoma parents and students. CLICK HERE to read more about how I pushed back on the Department of Homeland Security to end its ""disinformation Board,"" which they ultimately ended after my pressure. In one of our nation's biggest victories to protect the lives of the unborn, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this year, which allows the question of how to protect unborn life to go back to the people's representatives. Countless lives have already been saved because of the Dobbs decision, which I supported on the steps of the Supreme Court and in a ""friend of the Court"" brief. CLICK HERE to learn more about my push for the Supreme Court to stand for life in our nation. In response to the Supreme Court's decision, Democrats in the Senate tried multiple times to pass a bill requiring every state to permit abortion on demand, even until the moment of birth. We were able to defeat each attempt, and I stood up on the Senate floor in defiance of this bill. CLICK HERE to watch my stand against the abortion-on-demand until the moment of birth bill. Not just based on faith, but also based on science, millions of Americans-myself included-believe that a child in the womb, is a child. They have fingers and toes, a beating heart, a functioning nervous system and DNA that is uniquely different than any other person on earth. That child in the womb is not a random clump of tissue; that is a baby. They are not medical waste; they are valuable. CLICK HERE to watch my remarks on the Senate floor earlier this year to remind my colleagues of these simple facts. Democrats in the Senate were so extreme this year that multiple times they blocked me from passing a bill that would protect the rights of medical providers who have a moral objection to performing an abortion. My bill did not even limit abortion; it just gave women serving in a medical field the choice of whether they wanted to participate in abortion procedures. But the ""pro-abortion"" crowd in Washington, DC, would not allow women the choice to not to participate in an abortion. CLICK HERE to read more about my Conscience Protection Act. The Supreme Court also ruled on a case that I was personally involved in, when a high school football coach in Washington named Joe Kennedy was reinstated to his position after being fired for silently praying on the field after games. My team and I were directly submitted a ""friend of the court"" brief to make the argument for freedom to the Justices. The Court renewed the right for people of all faiths to live their faith, change their faith, or have no faith. CLICK HERE to read more about my support for Coach Kennedy. While these victories at the Supreme Court signaled a strong defense of liberty, that didn't stop politicians in Washington from doing their best to discourage any expression of personal faith. For more than 18 months, I argued with the White House and Pentagon leadership over the right of individual members of the military to request a religious accommodation for the COVID-19 vaccine. Thousands of service members, from multiple faiths, requested an accommodation, but very few of them even got an answer from the Pentagon. They were just isolated and told to wait, for months. In response, I blocked some of Biden's nominations to personnel positions in the Department of Defense for over a year to push back for members of the military have been prevented form serving our nation while also living their faith. Religious accommodations are not uncommon for members of our military, but the way these accommodations were handled has been very uncommon and obstructionist. Our founders considered your faith your most precious possession and that the government had no right to take your faith away from you. That is an American value that we should protect and export to other countries. While it sometimes seems like our country's core values of life, liberty, and family are under attack, I do everything I can to protect that right for the next generation and for people of all faiths. There is more work to be done in the days ahead, but I wanted to take a few minutes to update you on some of my and my teams' work in 2022 for Oklahomans.

318," Risch: Massive $1.7 Trillion Government Spending Bill Dramatically Misses the Mark Contact: Amy Hasenberg FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE December 22, 2022 Risch: Massive $1.7 Trillion Government Spending Bill Dramatically Misses the Mark Slams earmarks for Democrat pet projects in 4,100 page bill WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) released the following statement after voting against the $1.7 trillion government spending bill : ""At a time when Idahoans are facing the highest prices in decades, it is insulting for Congress to spend another $1.7 trillion that will add fuel to the inflationary fire. The 4,155 pages of this monstrous bill include billions for liberal priorities and pet project giveaways. ""We have got to rein in government spending, abandon earmarks, and treat taxpayer dollars with respect. This omnibus dramatically missed that mark."" The $1.7 trillion FY 2023 Omnibus bill "" fulfills 98 percent of Democratic Member requests "" and includes $5 billion for over 3,200 liberal pet projects including: Over $800 million for housing for illegal immigrants ; $2 million for a wax museum in Baltimore ; $750,000 to provide ""workforce development programs and supportive services for Transgender and Gender nonconforming and Intersex (TGI) immigrant women in Los Angeles""; $3.6 million for a Michelle Obama Trail in Georgia; and Preventative language to ensure no funding for Customs and Border Protection is used to improve border security.

319," Click here to receive my Newsletter ABOUT GT CONTACT ISSUES MEDIA CENTER SERVICES Dear Friends, As I work on your behalf in Washington, D.C., my mission is to advocate for Pennsylvania's priorities at the highest levels of government. I am sharing with you the Good, the Bad, and the Local for what's happening in Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District. I am grateful to be your representative in Congress. Please don't hesitate to reach out to my offices if I can be of assistance to you. Sincerely, Rep. Glenn ""GT"" Thompson The Good SUPPORTING LOGGERS: Last week, I cosponsored H.R. 2213, the Safe Routes Act of 2021 , which gives logging trucks the option to avoid pedestrians, school zones and intersections by allowing greater access to the Federal Interstate Highway System. Current law prohibits trucks that meet certain state-determine requirements from using the federal interstate, forcing them to use state and local roads, which increases risks associated with their trips. The Safe Routes Act of 2021 is straight-forward legislation that will have a tremendous positive impact on safety for both the public and log truck drivers nationwide. Local routes would also see a decrease in traffic, which could lead to increased road life for municipalities. PRISON REFORM: As a cosponsor of the House companion bill (H.R. 5975), I was proud to vote in favor of S. 2899, the Prison Camera Reform Act of 2021 , last week. This bill requires the Federal Bureau of Prisons to ensure all correctional facilities have the security camera coverage necessary to protect the civil rights and safety of incarcerated people and staff. There have been countless documented acts of violence and civil rights abuses in America's prisons. For years, prison reformers, prison staff, and the Department of Justice Inspector General have urged Congress to reform the broken camera systems in our nation's prisons. Congress listened and delivered. BUTLER COUNTY CIVIL WAR VETERAN RECOGNIZED : I was proud to support H.R. 7514, which came before me last week for a vote on the House floor. I am a cosponsor of the bill, which designates the United States Postal Service located at 345 South Main Street in Butler, Pennsylvania, as the ""Andrew Gomer Williams Post Office Building."" Andrew Gomer Williams was a Civil War veteran, Pennsylvania State Representative, Pennsylvania State Senator, and local lawyer from Butler. SAVING LIVES THRU FLOOD RESEARCH : Last week, I supported S. 558, the FLOODS Act , which establishes a National Integrated Flood Information System to coordinate and integrate flood research at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This bill creates partnerships with higher education institutions to improve total water predictions and establishes a committee to ensure coordination of federal departments with joint or overlapping responsibilities in water management. The bill also improves flood risk communications, including flood watches and warnings. The Bad PUNISHING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS: I contacted Department of Labor Secretary Marty Walsh last week to oppose the Department of Labor's confusing and burdensome proposed rule regarding independent contractors. If implemented, the independent contractor proposed rule would have immediate and long-term disruptive effects on millions of workers and thousands of businesses at a time when the economy is facing high inflation rates. Independent contractors should not face punitive restrictions because they are self-employed. We should be supporting American workers, not creating rules to make it harder to earn a living. TIME TO FIX MEDICARE PAYMENTS: With statutory Medicare reimbursement cuts looming, I contacted the White House and Congressional Leadership last week and urged swift action to prevent the cuts. If no action is taken, medical groups and health care systems may have to eliminate services, furlough staff, implement hiring freezes, and delay population health initiatives. This will negatively impact those who rely on Medicare services. Having practiced nonprofit community health care in rehabilitation for nearly three decades, I am acutely aware of the federal government paying less than the cost of providing care for Medicare and has transferred the burden of increased health care costs to individuals, third party payers, and providers. We need to fix this process. INCENTIVIZING UNEMPLOYMENT: There are numerous reasons why unemployed Americans are not entering the workforce, including ongoing fears of COVID-19, disabilities such as ""long COVID,"" and other care responsibilities. Unemployment benefits and expanded Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsides are also among the factors contributing to the relatively low labor force participation rate in the United States, according to a new study by the nonprofit Committee to Unleash Prosperity. In 14 states, including Pennsylvania, unemployment benefits and ACA subsidies for a family of four with two people unemployed amount to an annualized equivalent of $80,000 a year in wages and benefits. As the national leader for career and technical education in Congress, I continue to work on restoring rungs on the ladder of opportunity, get Americans off the unemployment bench, and ensure individuals contribute to our nation's economy. There are more jobs available today than any time in U.S. history. The federal government should not be incentivizing people to stay home, but rather help employers compete for qualified and trained workers. The Local WATERSHED WARRIORS: Last week, I had the privilege of joining key stakeholders dedicated to working on protecting and promoting the work of the Spring Creek Watershed Commission in Centre County. Formed in 1997, its mission is 3-fold: To establish a long-range vision for the watershed that represents a consensus of thoughts and ideals that are commonly shared by the people of the Spring Creek Watershed. To establish a leadership role within the watershed to advance and coordinate projects and programs that are consistent with the long-range vision of the Spring Creek Watershed. To develop a long-range comprehensive Watershed Management Plan and a program of meaningful associated projects to protect and enhance the quality of life within the Spring Creek Watershed. Thank you to all the volunteers and key stakeholders engaged in watersheds across the Congressional District. DAIRY LEADERSHIP: On Friday, I was honored to join a meeting of the Grassroots Pennsylvania Dairy Advisory Committee. The group is made up of farmers and supporters of Pennsylvania's largest agriculture commodity - dairy. I appreciated the invitation to address their monthly meeting as the incoming Chairman for the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture, the first Pennsylvania Member of Congress in nearly 170 years that will serve in this role. With my family heritage of dairy farming, I will continue to lead on the industry's issues, including restoring the option of whole milk with flavor back into our school lunch programs. Thank you to our hard-working farm families who provide us with so many essential goods. TAKING TOURISM TO A NEW LEVEL: I had the honor of participating in the new Moshannon Valley Heritage Center ribbon cutting. This project is one of a kind and is a joint project led by the Happy Valley Tourism Bureau and the Visit Clearfield County Bureau. This new facility will be a destination for learning and a launching pad for finding adventure in Centre and Clearfield counties. The Heritage Center will also serve as an ode to local history and a visitor center, where artifacts, videos, and interactive historical installations will be displayed. The Center will also provide recommendations for the best food, events, outdoor adventures, and more around the region. * Click here to   from future communications ",Thompson

""I am very pleased to announce passage of important legislation that will allow CRIT, located in my district, to lease a part of its water allocation for use off the reservation to provide direct drought relief to surrounding Arizona communities. CRIT is currently using part of its allocation to help the State of Arizona maintain water levels in Lake Mead. Passage of this legislation allows the Tribe to further assist other communities in Arizona and, because it would only authorize the Tribe to lease water it conserves on the reservation, guarantees that no additional strain is placed on the already over-taxed Colorado River. Providing CRIT with leasing authority will finally give the Tribe control over its water and allow it to assist other communities suffering from water supply challenges,"" concluded Congressman Gosar.

325," Counting down top accomplishments over a decade of service Dear friend, I grew up the granddaughter of a hog farmer, so I understand first-hand how important our family farmers are to our local and national economy. In Illinois, we have some of the richest farmland in the nation, and agriculture is a top economic driver. That's why I've served on the House Agriculture Committee from my very first term, and worked with my colleagues across the aisle to fight for rural Americans and grow our agricultural economy. Together, we have taken steps to achieve a brighter future for agriculture - fighting for biofuels , introducing the Next Generation Fuels Act , and creating a path for rural America to have a seat at the climate change table with my Rural Green Partnership . I've helped two Farm Bills cross the finish line and worked to prepare a third. These critical packages have provided a stable and strong crop insurance program, allowed for more rapid delivery of high-speed internet to underserved rural communities and updated regulations to make it easier for young farmers to purchase land and access loans. During this last session of Congress, I was selected to Chair the Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management . As Chair, I traveled across the country to lead listening sessions with growers and producers and gave hundreds of farmers the opportunity to weigh in on the 2023 Farm Bill. Family farmers are the driving force behind so much of what makes our country strong, and during the last decade, I've worked to ensure a brighter future for the Heartland.

326," Home | Make' Em Squeal | Email Joni Warning! Sharing This Could Place You on Washington's Naughty List You better watch out! President Biden is making a list and checking it twice. Going to find out who is being naughty…exercising their constitutional rights. The Biden administration is paying more than $5 million to a group called Hack/Hackers to make lists of organizations and media they think should and should not be trusted. They then use their naughty and nice list to help police the content posted by family and friends online and confront those who might post what they deem as unapproved ideas. To no one's surprise, liberal outlets, like The New York Times, made Hack/Hackers' nice list for being ""reliable."" The naughty list of ""unreliable"" or ""conspiracy"" sources predictably includes conservative-leaning media, like The Daily Wire , which coincidentally exposed this new Washington enemies list! Here's how it works: A Facebook post could be submitted to the Hack/Hackers Analysis and Response Toolkit for Trust to be reviewed for ""misinformation harms."" If a post raises ""reliability"" red flags, the program will then help generate ""responses for daily conversations around sensitive topics."" Well here is a fact: Iowans and most Americans don't trust Washington and don't want the government or some state-sponsored group to tell us what we can and cannot think, say, or believe. And we certainly don't want the Biden administration spending our hard-earned tax dollars to keep lists of approved and unapproved opinions or encouraging citizens to troll their friends with government-generated propaganda! In fact, if this effort was applied to statements by the Biden administration, the ""fact checkers"" would be working overtime countering the disinformation being spread by the president himself . Such as the president's false claim that he ""cut the federal debt in half - a fact! "" The truth is since Joe Biden became president less than two years ago, more than $3 trillion has been added to the national debt! Or President Biden's now deleted tweet crediting his ""leadership"" for giving seniors ""the biggest increase in their Social Security checks in 10 years."" The ""increase"" is an automatic adjustment that occurred to keep pace with the record inflation being caused in part by the president's economic policies… December 2022 Squeal Award: President Biden That is why I am giving my December 2022 Squeal Award to ""the minister of misinformation"" himself, President Biden , for promoting blatant falsehoods while his administration is steering tax dollars into these Soviet-style propaganda tactics that target citizens and media who dare question the administration's narrative. I am also urging the National Science Foundation, which is providing funding to the Hack/Hackers, to pull the plug on this taxpayer-funded troll service!

We passed the Inflation Reduction Act , a package that does the most we've ever done to create millions of union jobs and promote affordable, sustainable energy production. It also lowers prescription drug prices, caps the price of insulin for Medicare recipients, and more than pays for itself by making billionaires pay their fair share. Still, it's disappointing we did not have the votes in the Senate to go further to address the climate crisis, tackle immigration reform, expand affordable housing, or establish universal childcare. In the wake of the Buffalo, Uvalde, and Highland Park mass shootings, and as gun violence continues to tear our communities apart, Congress finally passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act , legislation to enhance background checks, help keep guns away from domestic abusers, and invest in mental health and support after traumatic events. But there is still an urgent need for comprehensive legislation that builds on the package we passed. I also voted for the Assault Weapons Ban when it passed the House and support its final passage. Earlier this year, a Supreme Court decision overturned Roe v. Wade, part of a longer, coordinated attack on abortion rights and reproductive freedom. While Illinois has strong protections for reproductive rights, the same cannot be said at the federal level.

Right now, leadership positions among Democrats in Congress are dominated by members from coastal states. Take a look at this map - I'm going to be honest, I couldn't believe it when I first saw it. Make no mistake: it is critical that Midwestern voices in Congress are heard - and I'm working to make that happen. For the upcoming Congress, I have been elected to represent the Midwest on the Steering & Policy Committee , which helps decide committee assignments & leadership spots, and am joining the Heartland Caucus as an original plankholder, in order to bring more Midwestern pragmatism to Congress. Us Midwesterners may disagree on college football (ahem, Ohio) or the right way to prepare a hot dog (ahem, Illinois), but we share the same sense of decency & sensibility. That's something our politicized and polarized Congress seems to have lost, and it's high time we bring it back. - Rep. Elissa Slotkin P.S.

Amodei (NV-02) issued the following statement as we wait for the Senate on act on the Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus: ""For those of you confused by the years-long irresponsibility of never completing spending bills under Regular Order, when the Committee of jurisdiction in the mess that is the Senate failed to markup a single Appropriations bill this year, please remember that with a 50-50 split party control in the Senate and Kamala Harris being the tie-breaking vote, this is as to be expected, and not good stuff. What should be a ""clean bill"" - is instead a $1.8 trillion-dollar, 4,155-page bill laden with partisan initiatives. For those concerned that several Senate Republicans will vote alongside Chuck Schumer, please feel free to rain down your thoughts on them. And get ready, because you have two more weeks of misery with Democrat control in the House and the Senate until January 2, 2023. ""When the Omnibus vote comes to the House, however, leave no room for concern, because Republicans on this side of the Chamber will be unified with an overwhelming ""no"" vote."" ### OFFICE LOCATIONS Reno Office 5310 Kietzke Lane, Suite 103 Reno, NV 89511 Phone: (775) 686-5760 Fax: (775) 686-5711 Washington, DC Office 104 Cannon House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6155 Fax: (202) 225-5879 Elko Phone Phone: (775) 777-7705 Rep.

You can watch the video here . Unfortunately, due to an impasse in the U.S. Senate, all tax provisions - including H.R. 7305 - and some disaster relief provisions were excluded from the upcoming omnibus spending package. Be assured that I will reintroduce it quickly in the new session to get survivors the financial relief they need. In the meantime, I have published tax guidance information on my website . In line with Congressional Ethics rules, this is not to be taken as formal accounting, tax, legal, or other professional advice, and I encourage you to discuss these matters with a financial advisor, attorney, or CPA. In addition, the IRS website describes further guidance on tax relief for survivors of California wildfires. *DC Update* December has seen a flurry of legislative activity as Congress rushes to pass critical legislation before the Christmas holiday. I voted to pass the bipartisan 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) when it passed through the House by a vote of 350 to 80. Guaranteeing the strength and readiness of the United States Armed Forces is one Congress's primary responsibilities, and this annual legislation authorizes $858 billion for national defense spending, an increase of $45 billion over President Biden's request to Congress. The bill overturns President Biden's proposed cuts to arms procurement, missile defense, and military construction, better preparing our Armed Forces to defend our nation from malicious adversaries. This bill focuses on America's actual defense needs rather than the Democrats' woke ideology that prioritized forcing women into the draft. Additionally, this bill repeals the overreaching COVID-19 vaccination mandate on all active and reserve servicemembers, clarifies that all servicemembers separated for their refusal to receive the COVID-19 vaccines are now eligible for reinstatement, and provides full veteran benefits to servicemembers separated for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. I fought to include one of my amendments into the bill which waives repayments on FEMA disaster assistance mistakenly awarded to victims who applied for assistance in good faith, but no fraud was committed. I previously introduced the amendment as a bill, H.R. 539, the Preventing Disaster Revictimization Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives last year. Under current law, FEMA can come back weeks, months, or even years later to seek repayment of funds it awarded victims, even when the agency is at fault for making the error and the funds were appropriately used in the wake of a disaster. The bill also ensures that FEMA reports to Congress on its efforts to minimize similar errors in the future. Wishing You A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year With a joyful heart, I want to extend to you and your families my best wishes during this Christmas season. As it is written in Isaiah 9:6-7, ""For to us a Child is born, to us a Son is given; and the government shall be upon His shoulder, and His name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace."" During this joyous time, let us take the opportunity to express our eternal gratitude for the blessings that God has been bestowed upon us and for the love we share with our friends and family. As American citizens, we are blessed to live in such a great country. Our rights and liberties allow us to live as a free people, and these freedoms are upheld by our friends and family serving in the Armed Forces. This season, let us be sure to take the time to offer our thoughts and prayers to our service members abroad who cannot spend this wonderful Christmas season with their loved ones. Our servicemembers exemplify the true meaning of Christmas by selflessly risking everything to protect us, sacrificing their time and risking their lives to defend the American Way. For that, may God bless them and keep watch over them and their families. As this year comes to an end, I am honored for the opportunity you have given me to serve you in the North State and am thankful for the trust you have shown me by re-electing me to represent you. As the New Year approaches and we move into the 118th Congress, it is important to me that I understand your priorities and the policy issues that you care most deeply about.

336," 96 December 21st, 2022: Weekly Newsletter Washington is Completely Broken! Do you support this $1.7 trillion Omnibus bill? Yes No I don't know/No Opinion Taking this survey will sign you up for future news and updates from my office. This week Congress is set to vote on a massive omnibus spending bill that will fund the government through the next year. A basic duty of Congress is to manage our country's budget, yet on Thursday, we will vote on a 4,000-page bill with an estimated cost of $1.7 trillion and have roughly 48 hours to review it. This broken process is a big reason America is over $30 trillion in debt and fed up with Congress. Moreover, this type of rushed policy shuts out any discussion on reforms needed to the federal government - and under this Administration, the list of reforms is long. Here are some of the most absurd things in the bill: $47 billion in Ukraine funding The package ""expressly prohibits CBP funding from being used to improve border security,"" while ""at the same time, allocates $410 million towards border security for"" other nations $1,438,000,000 for membership in global multilateral organizations, including the UN $575 million for ""family planning"" in areas where population growth ""threatens biodiversity"" Gender programs in Pakistan and $200 million for a Gender Equity Fund $335,000,000 to prepare for an influenza pandemic! Including the use of surveillance tools So long as the Biden administration continues to advance policies that leave our borders open, disincentivize oil and gas production, and empower corrupt bureaucrats, I will oppose spending bills. Washington is in need of serious reforms. Holding our ground on spending is the best way for us to demand change. We must make a return to sensible lawmaking practices and avoid massive spending packages. Protecting Our Children Last week, Democrats invited several far-left activists to testify before the House Oversight and Reform Committee to discuss ""LGBTQ violence in America."" During the hearing, I raised serious concerns about a witness' pro-trans agenda that her non-profit pushes, and the devastating consequences this ideology can have. Some of the responses were shocking: What Happened to Parental Rights? When I asked whether parents have a right to know what is going on in their child's life, the witness responded that parents do not. According to her, your child's mental health is better in the hands of a ""trusted adult."" Who is more trusted than a child's parents? How Young is Too Young to be Trans? I followed up by asking the witness about the age of consent for gender identity mental health therapy. She responded with ""12 years old."" This means a child could consult a ""counselor"" about their gender identity and begin undergoing ""gender-affirming"" counseling without their parents' knowledge. This, along with other measures I've seen working their way through Congress, are proof of the effort to intentionally work around parents to groom and influence our kids. What about the Detransitioners? I ended by pointing out that there are people who have undergone sex-change surgery and are now attempting to detransition. While the witness claimed that she has never heard of anyone regretting their sex change, there are several notable cases in the news. Despite what they tell children, sex changes are not only permanent, they have devastating consequences for someone's physical and mental well-being. Following the hearing, I joined Newsmax to discuss the shocking answers the witness gave. Standing For Life Last week, I led Members of both the House and Senate in an effort to fight back against the Biden administration's attempt to provide taxpayer-funded abortions. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) seems to have issued this rule in apparent response to the Supreme Court's ruling that rightfully overturned the misguided Roe v. Wade decision . This decision returned the issue of abortion to the American people to decide through their state legislatures. Congress has annually included language in spending bills stating that no federal funding can go to abortion. The VA is knowingly violating the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, which explicitly prohibits the VA from providing abortion services. No American should be forced by our government to pay for someone else's abortion. The Biden administration is abusing its authority and ignoring the law to enforce a radical, anti-life agenda. The VA should remain committed to providing care to support the lives of our veterans, not be used as a political tool by the Biden administration to illegally provide taxpayer-funded abortions. Impeaching Secretary Mayorkas Last week, House Republicans and I called for the impeachment of DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as a result of the Biden administration's refusal to secure the border. Mayorkas has repeatedly lied to Congress, intentionally spread falsehoods about CBP agents, and unlawfully canceled contracts and programs that Congress passed to help end this border crisis. The Secure the Fence Act of 2006, requires DHS to have operational control of the border, which he has failed to achieve. Section 4, Article 4 of the Constitution states that the federal government must protect states from invasion. Not only has this Administration failed to do so, they use taxpayer dollars to actively aid and abet the cartels perpetuating the invasion. As I have said before, if you could design a framework for border security that best supports the cartels' operation, it would be the one currently implemented by the Biden administration. Open House! Reminder: My DC office is hosting an Open House on January 3 ahead of my swearing-in ceremony. If you're able to join us in DC, please RSVP with this link .

340," NEWS ALERT! Sen. Rick Scott on Pelosi-Schumer Omnibus: I Won't Support The Reckless Spending of Taxpayer Dollars Senate Democrats Block Sen. Rick Scott's Calls for Standalone Hurricane Relief Bill As the Senate considers the massive and reckless $1.7 trillion Pelosi-Schumer Spending Bill, Senator Rick Scott continued his fight to pass disaster aid for Florida families as independently from any omnibus funding package. Instead of standing with Florida families who are fighting hard to recover from Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, Senate Democrats have for months delayed consideration of a hurricane relief package and chosen to use Floridians as pawns in exchange for approval of their reckless $1.7 TRILLION omnibus. Today, Democrats continued to hold Floridians hostage and blocked Senator Scott's request for quick passage of this needed relief. Watch Senator Scott's remarks HERE or below. Sen. Rick Scott: $1.7 Trillion Pelosi-Schumer Spending Spree is a Reckless Inflation Bomb Senator Rick Scott hosted a press conference regarding his and his colleagues' opposition to the $1.7 trillion, 4,000+ page Pelosi-Schumer omnibus spending bill that is being fast-tracked through the Senate without proper consideration. Senator Scott was joined by Senators Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Ron Johnson and Mike Braun. Earlier this month, Senators Scott and Lee wrote an op-ed for Fox News and urged the passage of a clean continuing resolution (CR) on the Senate floor to extend government funding until after the new Congress begins in 2023. Democrats blocked approval of this bill. Last month, Senator Scott joined Senators Lee, Ted Cruz and Mike Braun in writing a letter to leadership expressing the need to pass a short-term CR that funds the federal government only until shortly after the 118th Congress is sworn in. Additionally, in September, Senator Scott, along with Senators Cruz and Lee, demanded the passage of a clean CR that simply maintains current federal functions and programs until a new Congress begins in 2023, which Democrats blocked. Watch Senator Scott's remarks HERE or below. Sen. Rick Scott in the Tampa Bay Times: Why I can't vote for a $1.7 trillion spending spree Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for the Tampa Bay Times slamming the $1.7 TRILLION Pelosi-Schumer Omnibus Spending Bill for forcing Florida families to accept billions in reckless spending in exchange for needed disaster relief. In the op-ed , Sen. Rick Scott wrote, ""In typical Washington fashion, Florida families fighting hard to recover from Hurricane Ian are being held hostage in exchange for approval of the massive and reckless $1.7 trillion spending bill. Immediately after the storm passed, I made clear that I would fight for and support a standalone disaster aid funding package to get Floridians the assistance they deserve and need to recover. To tell folks in the Sunshine State who are still picking up the pieces left by Hurricane Ian that this aid only comes as part of a 4,000+ page omnibus spending bill is sickening. I won't stand for it. … America's national debt is $31 trillion and growing. When are we going to be so fed up that we decide this isn't sustainable? … Let's be clear: These spending bills aren't just our essential duties. They become huge policy and spending casseroles feeding Washington's favorite type of compromise where everyone gets everything they want. The result is more debt, more inflation and less accountability in how Congress spends your tax dollars. … The truth is, at more than 4,000 pages, the spending bill has a lot of policies and funding priorities I fought for this year. It has more funding to preserve and protect Florida's Everglades, funding to support our military and, yes, disaster aid for the families and communities devastated by Hurricane Ian. I support all of these things, but I will never support the other parts of the bill that continue gross, reckless spending of taxpayer dollars. These are things like $2.3 million so the Department of Education can reach out to student loan borrowers and urge them to apply for Biden's illegal debt forgiveness program, more than 7,500 member projects, funding for Biden to continue supersizing the Internal Revenue Service with 87,000 new agents and continuation of policies that force every family to give the IRS visibility into their personal finances. I ran for Senate Republican Leader because I am sick and tired of seeing dysfunction in Washington create hard times for families in the Sunshine State. … Democrats want to hold us hostage by saying that we can have hurricane relief in exchange for billions in reckless spending and hundreds of pages of radical policy. I say no. … I promised you that I'd do that and I won't go back on my word."" Read the full op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times HERE . Official Website   ",Scott
341," HOME ABOUT PRIORITIES NEWS SERVICES Dear Neighbor: I wanted to take a moment to share an update about how my staff and I have been working over the last few months for the people of Maryland's Eighth District. It remains a surpassing honor to serve as your Representative in Congress. As always, I encourage all of my constituents across the Eighth District to connect with me on Twitter , Facebook , and Instagram . If you need help with a federal agency and want to request my assistance, please complete the online request form here , and my District Office will be in touch. All Best, Jamie Raskin R ep. Raskin's October and November in Photos Spreading the Word About the PACT Act This summer, I was proud to vote to pass the Honoring our PACT Act , legislation to expand the promise of health care to our veterans exposed to toxins like Agent Orange, burn pits and more during their service. Not only does this law expand and extend health care eligibility substantially, through multiple provisions it also offloads much of the burden of proving covered health conditions from veterans. The PACT Act greatly expanded the medical conditions and exposure locations ""presumed"" related to military service, making it easier for vets to get care and treatment covered. This is perhaps the largest health care and benefit expansion in the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) history , so be sure to spread the word to the veterans in your life. You can read more about the PACT Act at the VA's website . In conjunction with Veterans Day, I convened a forum of leading VA officials to discuss how the PACT Act will help veterans in Maryland's Eighth District and across the country. Antione Waller, Director of the Baltimore Regional Office of the U.S. Veterans Benefits Administration and Michael Heimall, Director of the Washington D.C. V.A. Medical Center, joined me to share their expertise and explain the new law's key provisions. You can watch our full PACT Act Forum here . Championing Electric Vehicles Recently, I've been delighted to celebrate transformational electrification initiatives throughout our community. From MCPS' announcement of the largest school bus electrification project in the country to the billions of dollars for electric vehicle charging in President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law , Maryland's Eighth District and our country are taking decisive steps to address climate change and protect the planet for our children. Who better to champion these green-energy successes than MCPS school bus driver and sustainability advocate Sheila Martinez? Last month, Ms. Martinez graciously joined me on my Local Hero program to share what it's like to get up at 4:00 am to get our kids to school, and to discuss the numerous benefits of school bus electrification. Without giving too much away, I'll say that Ms. Martinez was skeptical of making the shift to an electric bus at first, but that didn't last long once she got behind the wheel of one of the buses in the electric fleet!

Investigating the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol When Congress established the January 6th Select Committee, nine representatives, Democrats and Republicans, accepted the urgent responsibility of investigating a domestic violent assault on our democracy, and delivering a comprehensive report to the American people. Since then, my committee colleagues and I have been diligently interviewing witnesses, reviewing documents and relaying our findings to millions of Americans through a series of dynamic hearings. You can watch these hearings on the January 6th Committee YouTube channel here .

Urging Cannabis Decriminalization I've fought for years to decriminalize marijuana, but even as forward-thinking states like Maryland vote to legalize, forty-three percent of drug arrests nationwide are cannabis-related . In November, I brought my decriminalization work to my Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, where we held a historic bipartisan hearing on efforts across the country to decriminalize cannabis. I was touched to hear colleagues on both sides of the aisle share deeply personal stories about the importance of legalizing marijuana. You can find an excerpt from my opening remarks here , and a full recording of the hearing here . Setting the Record Straight on the Second Amendment I'm sickened by the spate of deadly shootings that continue to afflict our nation, and I'm deeply troubled by the theory spreading in extremist right-wing circles that our Constitution guarantees the right to overthrow our government through violence.

343," Hello, Friends - On January 3rd, Republicans will begin the process of selecting the House Speaker, the most important vote of the 118th Congress. Today, I published an opinion piece in The Daily Caller on why Kevin McCarthy should not be elected as Speaker of the House in January. Republicans need a real leader, not Kevin McCarthy. You can read my op-ed HERE or below. CONGRESSMAN GAETZ PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO HOUSE SPEAKER RACE On Jan. 3rd, Republicans will start the process of choosing the House Speaker. The Speaker will be second in line for the presidency and the most powerful elected Republican. The vote will take several ballots and possibly many days. After internal debate, Republicans will come together and pick the right leader for the role and that should not be Kevin McCarthy. The McCarthy camp is spinning that Kevin must be accepted because ""we have to avoid chaos."" Chaos for who exactly? The special interests that are counting on McCarthy as their lapdog? I'm worried about chaos in the lives of my constituents. They live under the chaos of vaccine mandates pushed by Kevin's donors. How well did Speaker Paul Ryan serve conservatives during then-President Donald Trump's first term? Are we glad that his tenure got off to a smooth start? It would have been better to have debated and chosen the right leader. Ryan, of course, supports McCarthy. Every single Republican in Congress knows that Kevin does not actually believe anything. He has no ideology. Some conservatives are using this fact to convince themselves that he is the right leader for the moment, as McCarthy is so weak he'll promise anything to anyone. As his mentor recently confessed, ""He lies. He'll change the lie if necessary."" McCarthy doesn't just respond to pressure from the Right. During several important junctures in the past decade, we've seen Cavin' McCarthy. On Ukraine, McCarthy voted yes for the $40 billion Ukraine aid package in May. He even pushed the Biden administration to further escalate conflict with Russia as he called for fighter jets to be transferred to Ukraine. During the Obama administration, McCarthy called for a no-fly zone to be enforced in Syria while the Russian military was operating there. McCarthy even bought into the Russia hoax. In June 2016, McCarthy told other GOP congressmen, ""There's two people I think Putin pays: [Rep. Dana] Rohrabacher and Trump."" If he'll fall for the Russia hoax, you won't be surprised that McCarthy took a knee to Black Lives Matter when it mattered. McCarthy joined Democrats last year to vote to remove historical monuments from the U.S. Capitol building. This is who Kevin is. He sticks his wet finger in the air to decide what position to take. He told confidants that Trump should be censured or resign. Leaders don't wait to see what the crowd wants. Leaders also don't take orders from lobbyists. McCarthy, who was previously honored as one of ""the tech industry's best friends in Congress,"" opposes legislation that would break up companies like Amazon and Apple. Would it surprise you if you found out that Jeff Miller, Kevin McCarthy's ""confidant,"" was a registered lobbyist for Apple and Amazon? Apple and Amazon paid Miller's firm over $1 million to lobby Republican members against breaking up Big Tech. Why exactly again are we supposed to coronate a man whose top adviser is a corporate lobbyist for the likes of Pfizer? McCarthy also failed in his duties to deliver a resounding House majority. He told voters we would have a 20-seat plus majority and said that 2022 could be ""one of the biggest election losses for Democrats."" Instead, we have a four-seat majority. It could be larger. McCarthy's campaign to falsely claim Joe Kent is a socialist played a role in Kent's tight 5,000 vote loss in Washington. Republican nominee Karoline Leavitt had McCarthy working against her up until her September primary. She fell just short in November. In sports, when the team loses games it is supposed to win, the coach gets fired. In business, when earnings vastly miss projections, the CEO is replaced. In Republican politics, a promotion shouldn't be failure's chaser. McCarthy knows he will end up failing Republicans and caving to liberals. That's why he opposes reinstating the motion to vacate, which was in place from 1801 to 2018. He wants to make sure conservative congressmen can't fix the problem once it's too late.   | Privacy Policy ",Gaetz

345," Dear  , It has been my pleasure serving as your representative in the 117th Congress. Together, we fought to lower taxes and reign in government spending, worked to bring down inflation , and stood up to foreign adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party.

346," Fellow South Dakotan, In the last two years, Congress has allocated nearly $80 billion for broadband-related services. The good news is that, in addition to sustained investment from telecommunications providers, this funding should help expand broadband access to areas where connectivity challenges remain unresolved. The bad news is that this funding is split among 133 programs at 15 different federal agencies. Every federal dollar that has been spent should go toward its stated purpose: expanding connectivity to truly unserved areas. Without stringent oversight, I'm concerned federal agencies will repeat past mistakes with this recent influx of broadband funding, which is why I recently launched a nationwide oversight initiative to review federal broadband programs. In Case You Missed It Click here or on the picture to hear more about my broadband oversight effort. What's Next? For too long, we have talked about closing the digital divide, and it's time to actually get it done. The best way to achieve this is by ensuring the funding and programs that Congress has already put in place actually go toward expanding internet access to areas that currently lack it. Anything short of a robust accountability effort risks leaving taxpayer dollars wasted and Americans still disconnected.

347," Message from Rep. Tracey Mann. Having Trouble Viewing? Click Here. Fellow Kansan, Thank you for subscribing to my newsletter! I'm excited to update you on my work in Washington, D.C. and the First District of Kansas. Please feel free to share this email with family and friends who may be interested. As always, if you have any comments, questions, or concerns, please contact my office - my staff and I are here and ready to assist you. Yours in service, This Week in Washington, D.C. Voting on Last-Minute Spending Bill This week, Members of the House of Representatives were called back to Washington, D.C. to vote on a $1.7 trillion spending package under the threat of the government shutting down. This is not the way that a Democracy is supposed to function. In fact, this is the first time in modern American history that one party has jammed an omnibus bill through Congress during the lame-duck session after losing control of the House. It's plain and simple - this is bad legislation passed in a dishonest, untimely way. While Washington Democrats had control of the House, it was their responsibility to pass normal spending bills. They never got their act together, so now we are stuck with this omnibus - a 4,155-page spending bill put together behind closed doors and with no input or oversight from House Republicans. Now, Americans are sure to face even higher rates of inflation because of this legislation and out-of-control spending. If you want to know why Americans chose to give control of the House back to Republicans in the 118 th Congress, look no further than this spending bill and the process by which it's being passed. Biden Administration WOTUS Rule Expected Soon T hanks to more regulatory overreach by the federal government, our nation's farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers have been forced to operate their businesses under five different definitions of ""water"" in the past ten years alone. Soon, they will have to operate under a sixth, as the Biden Administration is expected to release their final ""Waters of the U.S."" rule later this week. The new version of this rule will likely remove longstanding bipartisan exemptions for common water features found on farms and ranches. Meanwhile, the regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency is presently in question while the U.S. Supreme Court hears the case of Sackett v. EPA . Depending on how the Supreme Court rules in this case, producers might get a 7 th definition of ""water"" in 2023. The Biden Administration has created regulatory chaos for our nation's producers who work hard to keep us all fed, fueled, and clothed. Farmers are the original conservationists, and they deserve the gratitude and support of the federal government - not red tape and burdensome overregulation. They certainly don't need Washington Democrats telling them how to manage their own resources. Listen to my remarks on the House Floor about WOTUS. Read about the legislation that I co-sponsor: H.R. 2660, the Withstanding Attempts to Encroach on our Resources (WATER) Act. In the Office Rep. Mann Co-introduces Bicameral Measure to Prevent Lesser Prairie-Chicken Listing I refuse to sit idly by while the United States Fish and Wildlife Service imposes burdensome regulations on producers with no input from Congress. As we near the end of the 117 th Congress, I am using every tool at my disposal to fight tooth and nail against the designation of the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened species in places like Kansas. That's where Congressional Review Acts come in. This resolution, which has a companion in the Senate, calls for an absolute refusal of this rule, which should have no force or effect until Congress is consulted. We have had a single-party rule in Washington since 2020, but the American people have spoken - they want real leadership. I will continue to fight this absurd rule (which also happens to be a proxy war on American energy producers) even if it means reintroducing this exact same legislation in the 118 th Congress. For now, this Congressional Review Act is the best tool we have to fight this government overreach until the last day of this Congress. At a time when inflation is at a 40-year high and families are struggling to fuel their cars while keeping food on their tables, we should be working to eliminate barriers for the agriculture and energy sectors, not hamstring hardworking Americans with government overreach. This rule threatens the livelihoods of the men and women who feed, fuel, and clothe us all, which is why Congress must refuse to accept it. Read the full text of the legislation here. Read a few of the letters that I have sent with my colleagues opposing federal overreach in other mandatory conservation efforts: Letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Letter to the U.S. Department of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland See additional legislation that I have supported that opposes the endangered species listing of the Lesser Prairie-Chicken: H.R. 4370, the Listing Reform Act Watch my Floor Speech about the Lesser Prairie-Chicken. ICYMI: Voting Against Sixth Short-Term Continuing Resolution Members of the House are on their way back to Washington, D.C. this week because Washington Democrats have once again failed to fulfill their obligation of passing an annual budget for our government. Last week's vote on a sixth short-term continuing resolution in two years is no way to fund a government. Rather than passing an annual budget that provides certainty, Washington Democrats chose to pass a week-long extension to buy more time for them to gift Americans another multi-trillion dollar spending package right before the holidays. With record-high inflation and a national debt approaching $32 trillion, Congress should have an open and constructive debate on our nation's finances. This is a perfect example of why voters handed leadership of the House back to Republicans. Read more in my interview with the Hutch Post.

348," Carper's Connection December 21, 2022 Dear Friend, As you may know, Delaware is the lowest-lying state in the nation. This means that our state is especially vulnerable to the impacts of a changing climate. We continue to see Nor'easter storms and flooding batter our beautiful beaches and coastal communities, and experts predict that this is only going to worsen in the years ahead. Fortunately, we are taking action in Congress to restore and fortify our coasts. Last week, I led a bipartisan majority of my colleagues in the Senate to pass the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2022. WRDA is biennial legislation that authorizes flood control, navigation, and ecosystem restoration projects and programs for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The 2022 WRDA legislation includes historic advancements to address our water resources challenges in Delaware and across the country. As the lead negotiator of WRDA 2022, I'm proud to say that the bill includes the most significant advances to address climate change in more than two decades. Importantly, communities big and small will be able to benefit from this work. WRDA 2022 has clear economic benefits for the First State. The legislation ensures that Delaware's critical water and ecosystem infrastructure receives the care and maintenance needed to keep goods flowing and our economy moving forward. In addition to protecting our communities and restoring our coastlines, for the first time, WRDA will advance environmental infrastructure projects for Kent, New Castle, and Sussex counties. This will help address our state's drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater management needs. There's no denying that WRDA 2022 is a major bipartisan accomplishment. And, truthfully, I've barely scratched the surface of the good this bill will do for Delaware. I look forward to President Biden soon signing it into law, and seeing the benefits to the First State come to life in the months and years to come!

349," EMAIL RUBEN SUBSCRIBE Rep. Gallego gets screened for PACT Act benefits. Dear  , As an Iraq War veteran who slept next to toxic burn pits, I understand the fear many veterans have that they will one day get sick from exposures during their service. That is why I voted for the Honoring Our PACT Act which recently became law. The PACT Act expands VA health care coverage and benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances . It adds health conditions caused by these exposures to the VA's list of presumptions - shifting the burden of proof off of veterans so they can get the care they need faster. If you are a Vietnam, Gulf War, or Post-9/11 era veteran or survivor , I encourage you to get screened to see if you may qualify for PACT Act benefits. You can learn how by visiting or by calling 1-800-MYVA411 . Additionally, my team is here to help you navigate the PACT Act process. You can contact my office at 602-256-0551 or by email . Rep. Gallego speaks with veterans at a PACT Act screening event in Phoenix. Now that the PACT Act is law, it's my mission to ensure every Arizona veteran gets the benefits they deserve.

350," December 21, 2022 MASSIVE SPENDING FROM THE LEFT As we near the final days of Democrat rule in the House, Congressional Democrats are working to ram through trillions of dollars in new reckless spending to fund the failed Far-Left agenda that the American people overwhelming reject! I strongly oppose the massive spending agenda from House Democrats while our border is being overrun by the broken policies of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I will vote against any funding bill that includes additional taxpayer dollars to Ukraine until our southern border is secured from the invasion of terrorists, gangs, drug cartels, and human traffickers. Our first priority must be the safety & security of the American people. BIDEN'S BORDER CRISIS: The End of Title 42 Against the wishes of the Biden Administration, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts has temporarily HALTED the lifting of Title 42. This order is a step in the right direction to help prevent illegal immigration. The Biden Administration has illegally opened our southern border to facilitate the largest invasion in human history, resulting in crime, fentanyl, and human trafficking. Joe Biden must be impeached for violating his oath to defend our border & uphold our immigration laws, and the Biden-Harris officials who opened our border should be prosecuted for the harm they are causing our country! PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN Last year, parents showed up to school board meetings to voice their outrage at the leftist agenda that is infiltrating our schools. The Biden Administration responded by mobilizing the Department of Justice and FBI to intimidate and harass parents who dared to show up to school board meetings in opposition of the Biden political agenda. The radical left should never underestimate the power of parents or the love that we have for our children. Just last week, the Loudoun County special grand jury indicted former Superintendent Scott Ziegler. The young girls who were sexually assaulted in their schools and the parents who were lied to by school officials during the cover-up deserve justice. This is the first step towards holding every school official accountable for endangering our daughters in order to advance their radical political agenda. I introduced the Safety and Opportunity for Girls Act protect young girls in our schools from this dangerous leftist political agenda. My bill would keep our daughters safe in the girls' restroom by defining the word 'gender' in Title IX as sexual orientation, and not gender identity. STANDING UP FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT Last week, Illinois Democrats held hearings on House Bill 5855 to diminish Second Amendment rights in Illinois. The Left is working to release dangerous criminals onto our streets, defund the police, and ban guns so you have no way to protect yourself or your family! Extreme gun laws have only made crime worse. I am proud to belong to the Second Amendment Caucus and will always stand for our constitutional right to keep and bear arms in Congress! I am looking forward to spending Christmas with my seven children and nineteen grandchildren. We thank God for all the blessings in life, and for the birth of Jesus.

351," December 12 - 18, 2022 Well… at least a White Christmas has been secured. As families are wrapping up presents, we are wrapping up legislation in the Senate. We've had reasons for optimism this past week, including the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which passed in the Senate. We've worked hard on the NDAA all year, which authorizes funding for our national defense and includes many victories for South Dakota. Additionally, my legislation, the RESPECT Act, also passed in the House of Representatives. Both bills will now head to the president's desk for signature. More on both of these bills below in the Weekly Round[s] Up. Meetings this past week : I met with Julie Smith, the United States Ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council; Chris Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax; Hakainde Hichilema, President of the Republic of Zambia; and Abiy Ahmed, Prime Minister of Ethiopia. I also attended a roundtable with sub-Saharan African leaders, Department of State officials and several members of Congress. We also had our Senate Bible Study (Our verse of the week was Hebrews 4:12). This week at Senate Prayer Breakfast, instead of a traditional speaker, we gathered together and sang Christmas carols. We do this annually during the holiday season with one of my colleagues playing the piano (this year it was Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan). We also had Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia playing the harmonica! Topics discussed : The NDAA, the B-21 Raider bomber coming to Ellsworth Air Force Base, the RESPECT Act and U.S.-African relations. Votes taken : 13 - the most noteworthy was legislation that extended government funding for an additional week, which I did not support. Each year, Congress is expected to pass appropriations bills that fund government for the fiscal year beginning on October 1. This year, Congress did not do this, but instead passed a continuing resolution (CR) which kept government funding at its existing levels until December 16. I voted against this measure in September. Even with an additional two months to work on appropriations bills, Congress has failed again to get its work done. CRs are no way to run a country. They're wasteful, ineffective, destabilize government programs and could end up hurting South Dakota families. They also jeopardize our military readiness. Military leaders continue to warn that CRs have a detrimental impact on our ability to train, equip and maintain the force. This is in part because out-of-date contracts remain enforced and new contracts are not in effect. This should concern us all. If we're ever going to stop this reckless practice of not getting our work done on time, we need to send a strong message that enough is enough. The American people expect us to do our jobs, not continue to kick the can down the road. NDAA : The National Defense Authorization Act is something that deserves its own category this week. The Senate passed this legislation this past week 83-11. The Senate Armed Services committee, which I have served on since coming to the Senate, has worked all year to craft this legislation. I authored 47 pieces of legislation that were included in the NDAA. Many of these were provisions to enhance our offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, and could potentially benefit Dakota State University in Madison. Additionally, the NDAA included over $335 million in military construction funding for projects at Ellsworth Air Force Base to help support the B-21 Raider stealth bomber bed down. I'm pleased to have the NDAA across the finish line in the Senate and heading to the president's desk to be signed into law. You can read more on the NDAA here . Legislation passed : The RESPECT Act. This is my bill to repeal discriminatory federal laws targeting Native Americans passed the House of Representatives this past week. The RESPECT Act repeals 11 outdated federal laws, including laws that stripped Native American children from their families for the purpose of placing them in ""Indian reform schools,"" such as the now-infamous Carlisle Indian Industrial School. It is long overdue to remove these immoral federal laws from our books. I've worked on this legislation for seven years, and I am pleased this bipartisan, commonsense legislation is heading to the president's desk to be signed into law. You can read more on the RESPECT Act here . Hearings : We had a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on cryptocurrency and the fall of FTX. Kevin O'Leary from Shark Tank testified before our committee on this issue. Classified briefings : I had a classified briefing with General Saltzman of the Space Force and a classified briefing with Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks. Additionally, I served as ranking member for a classified briefing on Russian activity in Africa for the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health Policy. Snow received : Like most people in the state, my state offices were snowed in and talking to South Dakotans remotely this past week. My Sioux Falls office received about six inches of snow, and my Aberdeen office received nearly 11. Pierre received over 14 inches, while the Rapid City office received nearly eight. I know my staff is looking forward to getting back on the road soon! Steps taken this week : 55,123 steps or 25.09 miles. Video of the Week : This week I visited with KELO about the NDAA. You can watch their news report here:   Mike@ is an unmonitored account. Please visit to contact my office. ",Rounds
352," Friends, Last Tuesday, my colleagues and I held a bipartisan hearing to hear firsthand about the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange, FTX. During this, I had the opportunity to question the new FTX CEO, John Ray, about the firm's failure and his efforts to help pay back over one million listed creditors. In the 118 th Congress, we would like to take the collapse of FTX and do something positive. We need to have a consensus on both sides of the Hill on the right kind of regulatory proposal for digital assets - one that protects customers, investors, and preserves the ability for innovation using blockchain technology. I joined Liz MacDonald on The Evening Edit last week to discuss the hearing and the importance of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX, to come and testify under oath before the Committee. My full interview can be viewed by clicking HERE or on the photo below. NEXT GENERATION OF FARMERS I recently had the pleasure of joining the Arkansas Farm Bureau for breakfast. It was wonderful to meet with the Young Farmers and Ranchers Committee to discuss the Farm Bill, droughts we've recently experienced in our great state, and inflation's impact on farmers throughout Arkansas. I look forward to seeing the impact this next generation of farmers has on our state's farming and agricultural industries. I am glad these agricultural leaders were able to make the trip up to Washington! To learn more about the Arkansas Farm Bureau, please click HERE .

Below is a guideline outlining the major symptoms for each of these, as well as who is most at risk if infected. I encourage you to contact your doctor with any questions you may have, as well as reach out about what you can do to keep you and your family healthy this holiday season.

355," PRESS RELEASE For Immediate Release December 21, 2022 ESPAILLAT, GARCÍA, NORTON, PRESSLEY, KEATING, APPLAUD INCLUSION OF $800 MILLION IN ASYLUM SEEKER AID IN 2023 GOVERNMENT FUNDING BILL After months of advocating for increased dollars, lawmakers secure a new shelter and services grant program with the goal of supporting states, localities, and NGOs providing shelter and respite to recently arrived migrants WASHINGTON, DC -- Today, Congressman Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) , along with Congressman Jesús G. ""Chuy"" García (IL-04) , Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) , Congressman Bill Keating (MA-09), and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) applaud House and Senate Appropriations leadership for including $800 million to provide shelter, food and supportive services to individuals and families experiencing hunger or homelessness, and allowing humanitarian assistance to migrant families and individuals encountered by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The funds will aid in expanding shelter capacity, and provide mental health services, adequate food, and appropriate legal services that are critical in supporting asylum seekers with legal counsel and other necessary services to facilitate a smooth process. The new grant program is to be administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as grants or cooperative agreements with state and local governments and NGOs, including up to $50 million for construction and expansion of shelter facilities. The majority of the funds are to be made available through the existing FEMA Emergency Food and Shelter Program until transition to the new Shelter and Services grant program is complete. Since March of this year, safe haven cities such as Philadelphia, New York City, the District of Columbia, Chicago, and Boston have experienced increased demand for safe and secure shelter. These locations have experienced an influx of asylum seekers from Latin America, predominately from Venezuela, who are fleeing a government that has engaged in ""crimes against humanity,"" including the use of torture and sexual violence to repress dissent. ""The inclusion of $800 million in the omnibus federal funding package will help bolster our efforts to support local shelter cities and ensure municipalities have the capacity and bandwidth to support vulnerable individuals and families when they need our help the most,"" said Congressman Espaillat. ""Migration from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Colombia is a longstanding issue, and there is no question that Republicans have weaponized this issue. However, we have a moral obligation to answer this call to action, and this funding is part of our whole of government approach, from federal, city and state efforts to ensure asylum seekers have the support and resources needed during this critical time in their lives and for our nation."" ""I am pleased to see increased funding for the FEMA Emergency Food and Shelter Program included in the government funding package,"" said Congressman García . ""My colleagues and I heavily advocated for these funds to urgently provide aid to families in need. Robust funding for this program will alleviate the pressures that community organizations have been facing for months. However, it is incumbent upon us as legislators, to address the root causes of migration and work on meaningful immigration reform. As we move into the 118th Congress, I strongly urge Republicans to stop playing political games with people's lives and come to the table next year with humane immigration proposals that honor our values as a nation of immigrants."" ""I am pleased that the omnibus appropriations bill released last night includes $800 million for FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter Program for humanitarian assistance for vulnerable migrants,"" Congresswoman Norton said. ""After this year's series of cynical political stunts in which governors from across the country bused migrants to large cities, including D.C., this humanitarian assistance was badly needed."" ""Our communities have risen to the challenge by welcoming and supporting migrants, but this has come at a cost to state and local governments and local non-profits,"" said Congressman Bill Keating. ""This $800 million in funding for the Department of Homeland Security will ensure that migrants have access to the necessities and humanitarian assistance they need directly through DHS."" ""Families fleeing humanitarian crises abroad deserve to be met with compassion and care,"" said Congresswoman Pressley. ""While Republican governors shamefully exploited vulnerable people, we have been head down advocating for the necessary federal resources to provide migrant families the shelter, food, medical care, legal services and trauma support needed to help them meet their most basic needs. I'm proud to help deliver these federal resources to help localities in Massachusetts and beyond do this essential work, and I won't stop pressing to address the root causes of displacement and migration and transform our immigration system into one that centers peoples' dignity and humanity."" Earlier this year, Rep. Espaillat along with Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) , Congressman Jesús G. ""Chuy"" García (D-IL) , and Congresswoman Pressley (MA-07) sent a letter with 19 colleagues to the House Appropriations Committee requesting that the upcoming fiscal year 2023 continuing resolution provide an additional $50 million above the enacted fiscal year 2022 level to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Emergency Food and Shelter Program for humanitarian assistance to migrants. Earlier this year Members of Congress also sent a letter to Senate and House Appropriations Committee leadership urging the inclusion of $500 million to support the Emergency Food and Shelter Program. Today's announcement exceeds their request and meets the demand on the ground. # # # Representative Espaillat is the first Dominican American to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives and his congressional district includes Harlem, East Harlem, West Harlem, Hamilton Heights, Washington Heights, Inwood, Marble Hill and the north-west Bronx.

""Chuy"" García (IL-04) , la congresista Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), el congresista Bill Keating (MA-09), y la congresista Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) aplaudieron al liderazgo de asignaciones presupuestarias de la Cámara y al Senado por asignar $800 millones para proporcionar alojamiento, alimentos y servicios de apoyo a personas y familias que pasan hambre o no tienen vivienda y permitir la asistencia humanitaria a las familias y personas migrantes encontradas por el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS). Los fondos ayudarán a expandir la capacidad de los albergues y brindarán servicios de salud mental, alimentación adecuada y servicios legales apropiados que son fundamentales para apoyar a los solicitantes de asilo con asesoría legal y otros servicios necesarios para facilitar un proceso sin complicaciones. El nuevo programa de subvenciones será administrado por la Agencia Federal para el Manejo de Emergencias (FEMA) como subvenciones o acuerdos de cooperación con gobiernos estatales y locales y ONG, incluidos hasta $50 millones para la construcción y expansión de instalaciones de refugio. La mayoría de los fondos estarán disponibles a través del Programa de Alimentos y Refugio en Emergencias de FEMA hasta que se complete la transición al nuevo Programa de Subvenciones de Servicios y Refugio. Desde marzo de este año, ciudades santuarios como Filadelfia, la ciudad de Nueva York, el Distrito de Columbia, Chicago y Boston han experimentado una mayor demanda de refugio seguro y protegido. Estos lugares han experimentado una afluencia de solicitantes de asilo de América Latina, predominantemente de Venezuela, que huyen de un gobierno que ha cometido ""crímenes de lesa humanidad"", incluido el uso de la tortura y la violencia sexual para reprimir la disidencia. ""La inclusión de $800 millones en el paquete general de financiamiento federal ayudará a reforzar nuestros esfuerzos para apoyar a las ciudades santuario locales y garantizar que los municipios tengan la capacidad y los recursos para apoyar a las personas y familias vulnerables cuando más necesitan nuestra ayuda"", dijo el congresista Espaillat . ""La migración desde Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua y Colombia es un problema de larga data, y no hay duda de que los republicanos han convertido este problema en un arma política. Sin embargo, tenemos la obligación moral de responder a este llamado a la acción, y este financiamiento es parte de nuestro enfoque del gobierno en su conjunto, de los esfuerzos federales, locales y estatales para garantizar que los solicitantes de asilo tengan el apoyo y los recursos necesarios durante este momento crítico en sus vidas y para nuestra nación"". ""Me complace ver un aumento de los fondos para el Programa de Alimentos y Refugio en Emergencias de FEMA incluidos en el paquete de financiamiento del gobierno"", dijo el congresista García . ""Mis colegas y yo abogamos fuertemente por estos fondos para brindar ayuda urgente a las familias necesitadas. La financiación sólida para este programa aliviará las presiones que las organizaciones comunitarias han estado enfrentando durante meses. Sin embargo, nos corresponde a nosotros como legisladores abordar las causas fundamentales de la migración y trabajar en una reforma migratoria significativa. A medida que avanzamos hacia el Congreso 118, insto encarecidamente a los republicanos a que dejen de jugar juegos políticos con la vida de las personas y se sienten a la mesa el próximo año con propuestas de inmigración humanas que honren nuestros valores como nación de inmigrantes"". ""Me complace que el proyecto de ley de asignaciones presupuestarias generales publicado anoche incluye $800 millones para el Programa de Alimentos y Refugio en Emergencias de FEMA para asistencia humanitaria para migrantes vulnerables"", dijo la congresista Norton. ""Después de la serie de acrobacias políticas cínicas de este año en las que los gobernadores de todo el país llevaron a los inmigrantes en autobuses a las grandes ciudades, incluido D.C., esta asistencia humanitaria era muy necesaria"". ""Nuestras comunidades han estado a la altura del desafío dando la bienvenida y apoyando a los migrantes, pero esto ha tenido un costo para los gobiernos estatales y locales y las organizaciones locales sin fines de lucro"", dijo el congresista Bill Keating . ""Estos $800 millones en fondos para el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional garantizarán que los migrantes tengan acceso a las necesidades y la asistencia humanitaria que necesitan directamente a través del DHS"". ""Las familias que huyen de crisis humanitarias en el extranjero merecen ser recibidas con compasión y darles la debida atención"", dijo la congresista Pressley . ""Mientras los gobernadores republicanos explotaban vergonzosamente a las personas vulnerables, nosotros hemos estado abogando consistentemente por los recursos federales necesarios para proporcionar a las familias migrantes el refugio, los alimentos, la atención médica, los servicios legales y el apoyo de trauma que necesitan para ayudarlos a satisfacer sus necesidades más básicas. Estoy orgullosa de ayudar a entregar estos recursos federales para ayudar a las localidades de Massachusetts y más allá a hacer este trabajo esencial, y no dejaré de presionar para abordar las causas fundamentales del desplazamiento y la migración y transformar nuestro sistema de inmigración en uno que se centre en la dignidad de las personas y sea humano."" A principios de este año, el Rep. Espaillat junto con la congresista Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) , el congresista Jesús G. ""Chuy"" García (D-IL) y la congresista Pressley (MA-07) enviaron una carta junto a 19 colegas al Comité de Apropiaciones de la Cámara que solicita que la resolución continua del próximo año fiscal 2023 proporcione $50 millones adicionales por encima del nivel promulgado para el año fiscal 2022 al Programa de Alimentos y Refugio en Emergencias de la Agencia Federal para el Manejo de Emergencias para asistencia humanitaria a los migrantes. A principios de este año, los miembros del Congreso también enviaron una carta a los líderes del Comité de Apropiaciones del Senado y la Cámara instando a la inclusión de $500 millones para apoyar el Programa de Alimentos y Refugio en Emergencias. El anuncio de hoy supera su solicitud y satisface la demanda sobre el terreno. # # # El congresista Espaillat es el primer domínico-estadounidense en servir en la Cámara de Representantes de los Estados Unidos y su distrito congresual incluye las comunidades de Harlem, East Harlem, West Harlem, Hamilton Heights, Washington Heights, Inwood, Marble Hill y el noroeste del Bronx.

356," From Dr. Murphy's Desk Dear Friend, With 2022 coming to an end - and as your Representative in Congress - I want to share some of our biggest accomplishments and milestones from this past year. I am so grateful to serve our community in Eastern North Carolina, and I'm looking forward to another productive year on behalf of the Third Congressional District! If you would like to share my e-newsletter with others, please direct them to this link to subscribe. 2022 Year in Review My number one priority as your Representative in Congress is to serve you! As a physician of more than 30 years, I understand the value of listening to patients and delivering exceptional care. Our office operates with this same professionalism and mindset on behalf of constituents. Over this past year alone, our office aided over 1,222 constituents by resolving issues with federal agencies. This included helping veterans access delayed VA benefits, assisting families with overdue refunds from the IRS, and helping travelers renew their passports. My team and I worked diligently to communicate on the issues that matter most to you. We held numerous telephone town halls, connecting with tens of thousands of constituents, and proudly completed over 11,689 individual responses to constituent calls, letters, and emails. To get in touch with my office regarding legislation or other district-related issues, visit our website HERE . My office also helped return over $3.15 million dollars to hardworking North Carolinians in the form of IRS refunds, small business loans, disability retroactive payments, and more. I could not be prouder of our district casework team who works tirelessly to ensure residents have the resources and benefits they need. If you or a loved one are in need of assistance with a federal agency, please contact any of my district offices. We are here to help! When it comes to seeking solutions for Eastern North Carolina, I introduced a number of bills this year, tackling issues related to health care, higher education, veterans' affairs, and coastal waterway management. I worked across the aisle to streamline GI Bill benefits, permanently expand access to telehealth services, lower drug prices, and improve medical device operability. I also introduced measures to stop President Biden's decision to forgive student loans and pressure colleges and universities to divest from dangerous Chinese companies which are a threat to our national security. Our biggest achievement was one that was years in the making. In August, the Camp Lejeune Justice Act was signed into law as part of the Honoring our PACT Act. The bill will eliminate burdensome red tape to ensure that those exposed to toxic chemicals at Camp Lejeune, including servicemembers, Marine dependents, civil servants, and contractors, can receive their day in court. As the proud representative of more than 89,000 veterans , I am honored to have led the effort to make sure our Camp Lejeune community gets long-overdue care and benefits. Just a few weeks ago, the House also passed the FY2023 NDAA with my support. It will fully fund our military, provide $190 million for our Eastern North Carolina bases, and authorize a 4.6 percent pay increase for our troops. We achieved another major victory in the NDAA by formally eliminating the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for our service members. While we celebrate this long-overdue success for our war heroes, there is much more to be done. Now I'm pushing to formally reinstate U.S. service members who were involuntarily separated from the U.S. Armed Forces for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. I look forward to advancing a bill in a Republican-controlled House to deliver justice for our brave service members who were wrongfully targeted by the Biden Administration's vaccine mandate. This month, I hosted the second annual Campus Free Speech Roundtable in the U.S. Capitol to provide students, alumni, and stakeholders with a venue to discuss free speech violations in higher education. We brainstormed legislative paths forward for Congress to safeguard First Amendment protections for all students, regardless of political affiliation. As a member of the Congressional Free Speech Caucus, I am exploring several avenues to protect students' rights in higher education. Most notably, I am fighting to pass my bill, the Campus Free Speech Restoration Act to require public and private universities to report First Amendment violations to the Department of Education and publicly share campus policies on free speech. This bill would go a long way in holding our colleges and universities accountable because failure to comply would restrict federal funding. With the incoming Republican majority, it's more important than ever that Congress make free speech protections a top priority for our students. In 2022, I had the privilege of meeting with hundreds of Eastern North Carolinians to discuss some of the most important issues facing our country and learn about all of the wonderful ways that our community members are leading the nation in education, innovation, business, energy, waterway management, technology, and more. Meeting with constituents is one of the most important ways that I can learn about our community's needs, develop meaningful legislative solutions to those needs, and bring your priorities to the halls of Congress. I am so grateful to everyone who took the time to meet with me over the course of the past year to advocate on behalf of the Third Congressional District. This past fall, I hosted the second annual bipartisan WATERS Summit with my good friend Congressman David Rouzer in Wilmington, N.C. The purpose of this bipartisan conference was to hear from leading experts about human adaptation strategies to waterway challenges in North Carolina and develop legislative plans to combat these challenges over the next 5, 25, and 100-years. The event was a huge success, and my team and I are very excited about the next WATERS Summit, which will return to Greenville, N.C. in Fall 2023! Our efforts to bring together stakeholders and address these issues regularly are already paying dividends. In fact, Congress passed my bill, the Oregon Inlet Feasibility Study Act as a first step in addressing navigational, commercial, safety, and flood control concerns at Oregon Inlet. While there are many challenges that lie ahead of us, I am confident that a new House Republican majority will restore much needed balance to our country. Recently, House Republicans unveiled our Commitment to America policy agenda for an economy that is strong, a nation that is safe, a future that is free, and a government that is accountable. You can read more about our GOP Commitment to America in my North State Journal op-ed HERE . Thank you for taking the time to read some of my office highlights from 2022! As always, it remains a true honor to represent you in Congress. As we celebrate the beginning of a new year filled with new hurdles and opportunities, I look forward to another strong year of advancing key local and federal initiatives on behalf of our Third Congressional District.

364," News from Representative Johnson December 21, 2022 Dear  , Deadlines From end-of-year deadlines, performance reviews, next-year planning, data analysis, end-of-year budgets, businesses do a lot to close out the calendar year. This year, it seems Congress has one thing in common-the budget. Although the fiscal year ended on September 30, Congress didn't complete negotiations to pass a full spending package. Instead, Congress passed a continuing resolution to keep last year's funding levels until December 15. It didn't surprise many people when yet again, Congress couldn't negotiate by the deadline and extended it another week. By now, most people have finalized their important end-of-year projects and are spending time with family, prepping for Christmas parties, baking cookies, and drinking hot chocolate. However, Congress is back in Washington, D.C. to vote on an omnibus spending package to keep the federal government open and funded through the rest of the fiscal year. Don't get me wrong, I know passing a budget is necessary, which is why I introduced the GET IT DONE Act. This bill would motivate Members of Congress to work to pass a budget on time, and without repeated extensions, like how it has been done for years. If a small business can pass a budget on time and before its deadline, Congress should too. Year after year, we watch the can get kicked down the road. And it's usually a pretty expensive can. In the end, I'm confident Congress will keep the lights on, but it shouldn't have to be this way. I'm hopeful that in the new Congress, a Republican House Majority will pass a budget on time, just like South Dakota businesses do.

367," Dear Friend, This week, we're almost to the finish line-the end of the 117 th Congress. Before we leave Washington for the Christmas holiday, the House and Senate must address another deadline to fund the government before the end of the year. The Senate has released a behemoth 4,000-page bill that spends more than $1.7 trillion. My team and I are reviewing the legislation but it is yet another sign of how broken our budgetary process has become (like we mentioned in last week's newsletter). As the House awaits consideration of the FY23 spending bill, I think it is important to note that Congress, earlier this month, cleared important legislation of a different matter. The House and Senate adopted the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to provide for our national defense and included a welcome change for our military: an end to the COVID vaccine mandate for our service men and women. This draconian policy prompted the Department of Defense to discharge 3,300 Marines, 1,800 soldiers, 1,800 sailors, and 900 airmen based on their personal decision to not take the COVID vaccine-all while the Army and Navy missed their recruitment goals by thousands of service members. We are confident that this year's defense funding will strengthen our national security. In thirteen days, the real work will begin. The new Republican majority will be able to take a fresh approach to fixing our broken budget process and support our men and women in uniform. With our new majority, we will hold the Biden Administration accountable and work to restore every American's right to self-determine. The 118 th Congress is just around the corner, and there is much to look forward to.

368," Congressman David Price Enews Sign Up | Visit My Website About David | Serving You | Issues | Newsroom | Contact GET CONNECTED: Dear    , As the 117th Congress and my 34 years of service in the U.S. House of Representatives come to a close, I want to express my profound gratitude to colleagues, staff, community partners, constituents, and friends for your support and encouragement over the years and for all we have been able to accomplish together. It is unsurprising, unfortunately, that we find ourselves once again facing a possible government shutdown, scrambling to stitch together twelve appropriations bills to see us through the fiscal year. But despite the many twists and turns along the road, we are concluding a Congress that has produced major pandemic relief, infrastructure investments, high-tech manufacturing support, overdue veterans' health benefits, health care cost reduction, and clean energy legislation - all with a 50-50 Senate and a margin of only four Democratic votes in the House! As Chairman of the Transportation-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, I am particularly proud of the progress we've made in funding passenger rail, public transit, housing for the elderly and for people with disabilities, and housing for the homeless - and in bringing home major grants like $58 million for the Raleigh-to-Richmond rail corridor and $40 million for a Choice Neighborhoods grant in downtown Durham! As Chairman of the House Democracy Partnership - the bipartisan commission I initiated 17 years ago to help strengthen representative institutions in emerging democracies - I was particularly pleased to add Moldova, North Carolina's sister state, as a full partner during a visit to eastern Europe in October. I take great satisfaction in the legislative-strengthening program we have built from Kenya to Ukraine to Mongolia, but I leave office with acute concerns about the state of democracy in our own country and worldwide. I have kept on my office wall a picture of my high school senior class from Erwin, Tennessee, in front of the U.S. Capitol. It would have never occurred to me in that moment that I would one day serve in that building. During this time of reflection, my main emotion has been immense gratitude for those who believed in me and supported me - beginning with my wife Lisa, whom we lost this June, and our family, my wonderful staff, and thousands of citizens who have rightly seen representing the Fourth District as a joint venture, of which I was only the most visible partner. I am deeply grateful for your steadfast engagement and support over the years, and wish you a joyous holiday season. Sincerely, David Price Member of Congress WEBSITE |   | CONTACT Washington D.C.

369," Dear friend, As 2022 comes to an end, I wanted to reflect on the year and share some of some of what Congress has accomplished. After two tough years of a pandemic that brought on significant health and economic challenges, I'm proud of the progress we've made to lower costs for Virginians, strengthen our economy, and improve the health and safety of our communities. Watch a recap of our work together in 2022 here>>> I spent a lot of time on the road this year to see how funding from legislation I helped pass in 2021, like the American Rescue Plan and bipartisan Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act , is supporting families, businesses, colleges and universities, and our infrastructure. Every zip code of the Commonwealth has benefited from these bills, and it was great to hear directly from Virginians about how these bills are positively impacting them and what additional support they need. I'm also proud of the historic legislation we passed this year that's going to support Virginia communities for decades to come. To lower costs for Virginians and strengthen our economy: We passed the Inflation Reduction Act to lower health care, prescription drug, and energy costs for Virginians. This bill is also going to help Virginia continue to rocket ahead as a leader in clean energy and help us tackle climate change. I also helped pass the CHIPS and Science Act to boost domestic chips manufacturing, fix supply chain issues, improve our economic competitiveness, and protect our national security. I successfully pushed to extend the Metro Silver Line to Dulles -one of the most complex projects I've worked on in public life. This is going to connect the capital of the free world, Washington D.C., to our largest international gateway airport in Virginia, expand economic opportunity, and help reduce traffic. To improve the health and safety of our communities: I worked to get my Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act signed into law. Named after Dr. Lorna Breen, an emergency room physician from Charlottesville who died by suicide while working in New York City during the early days of the pandemic, this bill is critical to helping our health care healers get the mental health support they need. We also passed a bipartisan gun safety bill -the first comprehensive gun safety bill that Congress has passed in decades. We know painfully well in Virginia, especially following the tragic shootings at University of Virginia and Chesapeake, that we have more work to do. But I'm proud Congress showed that we're willing to get off the sidelines and take action to make our communities safer. To protect civil rights and recognize our nation's diversity: Congress passed the Respect for Marriage Act to protect marriage equality by ensuring same-sex and interracial marriages are recognized by every state. We confirmed the first African American woman to the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson . I pushed for unanimous Senate passage of my bill to designate September as African Diaspora Heritage Month . To support our servicemembers and protect national security: We passed the Honoring Our PACT Act to expand benefits to veterans exposed to toxins and burn pits during their service. And recently, we passed the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) , which is going to provide a pay raise for our servicemembers, support Virginia's defense community and shipbuilding industry, and bolster our national security. In addition to these many accomplishments, I helped pass the bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act to strengthen accountability and improve Postal Service operations. I also worked with Senator Mark R. Warner to save over 4,000 beagles from poor conditions at an Envigo breeding facility in Cumberland. Over the holiday season, I hope you all have a chance to think back over 2022, count blessings, and remember friends lost during the year. One person I'm thinking about is my congressman and friend, Donald McEachin, who we recently lost. But I also hope you are able to recharge your battery and think with hope and optimism about 2023. I look forward to building on this year's progress and seeing what else we can accomplish together next year. I wish you a happy new year, and I'll see you out on the road in 2023!

370," Big Wins in the Final Weeks of 2022 A Message From Congresswoman Sherrill Dear Friends,It has been a busy month in Washington wrapping up the 117th Congress and securing year-end wins for New Jersey's 11th District. I am writing to give you an update on the legislation we have passed this month, including this year's National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that will bring federal dollars directly back to the district to protect us against flooding, combat climate change, and strengthen our supply chains. I was also proud to vote to codify the fundamental right to same-sex and interracial marriage into law. Additionally, I stood alongside my colleagues to honor the United States Capitol Police with a Congressional Gold Medal for their bravery and sacrifice on January 6th.

Take care, Mikie Sherrill The 2023 National Defense Authorization Act I joined my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to pass the NDAA, a bill that will deliver a stronger national defense and support our men and women in uniform. I was able to secure key NJ-11 priorities, including major funding for Picatinny Arsenal and combating climate change, and the Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act. Click here to read more about what this year's NDAA is bringing back to NJ-11. Improving Our Water Infrastructure I am proud we were able to come together and include the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) in the NDAA. This bipartisan legislation will protect our neighborhoods from flooding events, restore our environment and ecosystems, and strengthen our nation's supply chains by supporting our ports and harbors. This year's WRDA enables the Army Corps to lay groundwork for future flood control projects and start critical water and wastewater projects in NJ-11 - from flood investigations and flood control feasibility studies for all four counties, the Whippany, Peckman, and Passaic Rivers to sewer installations in Jefferson to improve Lake Hopatcong's water quality and projects to remove PFAS from our drinking water. Learn more on my website . Protecting Federal Judges and Their Families The bipartisan, bicameral Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act , that Senator Bob Menendez and I introduced, was included in this year's NDAA. This bill will extend protections for all federal judges. U.S. District Court Judge Ester Salas and her husband tragically lost their son in a targeted attack on their home in July 2020. The gunman had previously argued a case before Judge Salas and used publicly available information to target the judge. Judge Salas and her husband experienced a tragedy that no parent should ever endure and with this bill, we are taking action to protect our public servants on the federal bench and prevent this type of violence in the future. Supporting Picatinny Arsenal Picatinny Arsenal, located right here in NJ-11, is a premier center for military innovation. The Arsenal is at the cutting edge of modernization of armaments and ammunition and is a critical player in the development of next-generation technology for the Department of Defense. It is our district's largest employer and contributes more than $1 billion to New Jersey's economy. I was proud to secure more than $152 million above the President's budget request for Picatinny programs in the 2023 FY NDAA. This funding will support the Arsenal's research and development capabilities and bring more highly paid jobs to New Jersey. Codifying the Right to Same Sex & Interracial Marriage I was very proud to stand with Americans across the country and vote to defend marriage equality. However, I was shocked that we had to vote for rights that are so intrinsic to who we are as a nation and as individuals. Unfortunately, extremist Republicans in Congress tried to take down the bill at the last minute. Make no mistake, regardless of who is in the majority, I will continue to fight for the safety, dignity, and rights of all Americans. Who you love and want to marry shouldn't be up for political debate or under legal attack. With this bill, we codified same-sex and interracial marriage to protect these freedoms from being infringed upon by extremists. Fighting for Women's Equality on the Field I joined Kelley O'Hara, former USWNT member and leader in the fight for equal pay, and Lindsay Kagawa Colas, a top women's sports talent agent, for a conversation on how we can improve opportunities for women on the field at youth, collegiate, and professional levels. As we head into 2023, I look forward to continuing to fight to strengthen Title IX, which has transformed not only the classroom, but also girls' access to sports and the benefits of athletic teams, including future scholarship opportunities. I will continue to be an advocate for investing in women's sports and for gender equality on and off the field. In case you missed it, click here to watch our live conversation! Honoring the U.S. Capitol Police The U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metro Police are the first people I see in the morning as I enter the Capitol and the last ones I see as I head home. Every day my colleagues, staff and I feel safe because of their service. On January 6th, they served with incredible bravery and heroism as they defended our democracy against an insurrection. I joined my colleagues in honoring them with a Congressional Gold Medal. Thank you for being our heroes. Our nation owes you a debt of gratitude.

371," Dear  , Far too many Montanans are struggling with mental health issues, and expanded access to services is critical to our rural communities and our veterans. That's why, earlier this year, I introduced a slate of bipartisan bills that will support Montana's mental health workforce and boost substance use disorder services, ensuring that Montanans across the state have greater access to care. Montana native Vincent Marsh, who aspires to join the mental health workforce, reached out to me to share his own struggle with depression and express his support for the package. We must ensure our health care workforce has the resources and tools they need to serve Montanans in every corner of our state. I won't stop fighting to get these bipartisan bills signed into law.

Here's a small snapshot of what my team and I have been doing on your behalf this Congress: [image: Image] With your support, we've consistently delivered for folks here in the Hudson Valley, including: - $57 million brought back to our communities in benefits and tax returns - More than 12,000 neighbors helped one-at-a-time - Permanently banned oil barge anchorages on the Hudson River - Delivered billions in debt relief for small farmers, like the Black Dirt family farms across our district - Supported our vets by cutting red tape and improving care for veterans exposed to burn pits - Revitalized American manufacturing, bringing a $20 billion IBM investment to the Hudson Valley - Invested in our aging infrastructure to repair and replace roads, bridges, water systems & more I could go on and on.

377," For Immediate Release December 20, 2022 The True Meaning of Christmas The most wonderful time of the year is in full swing. Americans across the country are last minute gift shopping, cooking festive meals, and traveling to visit family. Although this is typically a joyous and busy time for many, it's important to pause and remember the true meaning of Christmas. God sending his only son to pay the price of our sins through the birth of Jesus Christ is a testament of giving without receiving in return, which is the real significance of this special holiday. Through Jesus's time on Earth, He displayed genuine selflessness, grace, and love for each and every person he encountered. I am reminded of this especially around Christmas time, when our selfless first responders, doctors, servicemembers, and more, aren't able to be home for the holidays. I am forever grateful for their sacrifice for strangers and for the greater good of our country. These sentiments hold true in Congress. It's easy to get caught up in partisan divides and heated debates, but what matters most is what we all have in common: the duty to serve the American people. Despite our political differences in Congress, day in and day out, we are fighting for the priorities of our constituents. Being a strong voice in Washington for my fellow Oklahomans for a second term is something I'm incredibly grateful for this holiday season. Whether it's the true meaning of Christmas or Congress, this is a special time to unify under what matters most. I wish everyone a wonderful holiday season filled with joy shared with loved ones. ### Media Contact: Wesley Harkins: 202-225-2132 Rep.

380," Christmastime is the season of hope and joy-hope that even when times are dark, we can find the light and joy that follows. Weekly Column - December 20, 2022 Christmas: A Time of Hope and Joy By Congressman Dan Newhouse Christmastime is the season of hope and joy-hope that even when times are dark, we can find the light and joy that follows. The greatest gift the world has received is the birth of Christ and his salvation of humanity. The Christmas season is a time to reflect, to prepare, to spend time with family, and to celebrate. During this time, we must also be grateful and remember the contributions and sacrifices our forefathers and military service members endured to ensure our freedoms. We are blessed to have the freedom to celebrate the season of togetherness because of the actions of a few brave Americans on Christmas Day, in 1776. On that day, General George Washington selflessly led his soldiers across the Delaware River into battle, giving the Continental Army and the colonists hope-hope of freedom. Without that brave decision by our first president-and the sacrifices that came with it-we might not have the freedoms and rights we enjoy today. And today, our military service members, many away from home, keep a watchful eye to ensure our safety and freedom. I ask that you join me in saying a prayer and honoring our service members overseas who defend our nation and protect our right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Here at home, when we face many uncertainties and obstacles, one thing is certain-Central Washington's resilience and willingness to rise to a challenge should inspire in us all the spirit of hope and joy to face and overcome these challenges. We are blessed to live in a community that comes together, rain or shine, and lifts our neighbors up. I am grateful to represent such a resilient district that takes to heart the true meaning of Christmas. While Christmas is just one day, the season's spirit of giving is carried with us all year long. From my family to yours, I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

Please follow me on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , and YouTube for regular updates on how my team and I are working to serve you in Congress. Fighting back against political antics Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi brought the Puerto Rico Status Act to the House floor with less than 24 hours notice. There was virtually no to time to review it and even less to debate it. No estimated cost was provided by the Congressional Budget Office, though it is potentially staggering. We haven't added a state since Alaska and Hawaii in 1959. The debate on Puerto Rico's statehood deserves more than a last minute messaging bill that had no chance of even being voted on by the Senate. Such political antics are exactly what Americans loathe, but have been par for the course under Pelosi's reign. That will soon change under Republican leadership, giving serious legislation the attention it deserves. Constituent Corner Did you know my team can assist you with U.S. Postal Service claims?

More than 2.5 million American workers have participated in TAA since Congress first established the program in 1974. TAA now assists almost 100,000 workers annually, providing tuition-free job training, relocation allowances, income support, and a health coverage tax credit. The program expired on July 1, 2022, at which point the Department of Labor stopped accepting new applications and began phasing out activities. For more than five months, displaced American workers have been unable to apply for the benefits upon which they have been able to depend for nearly half a century. Congress recently made significant investments in infrastructure, semiconductors, and green technology. TAA has clear benefits for displaced American workers, but it also has an important role to play in supporting America's changing manufacturing sector. So, I sent a letter urging Congressional leadership to reauthorize TAA immediately and prepare American workers for future manufacturing jobs. Thank you to AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler, San Antonio AFL-CIO President Tom Cummins, and Texas AFL-CIO President Rick Levy for your support and input on this matter. Joining me on this letter were Representatives Debbie Dingell (MI-12), Donald Norcross (NJ-1), Pat Ryan (NY-19), Mark Pocan (WI-2), Bill Pascrell (NJ-9), Chellie Pingree (ME-1), Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC-At Large), Marcy Kaptur (OH-9), Tom Suozzi (NY-3), Nikema Williams (GA-5), Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11), Rosa DeLauro (CT-3), Linda Sanchez (CA-38), Cindy Axne (IA-3), Al Green (TX-9), Haley Stevens (MI-11), Jan Schakowsky (IL-9), Brendan Boyle (PA-02), Susan Wild (PA-7), Jimmy Gomez (CA-34), André Carson (IN-7), Jerrold Nadler (NY-10), Raul Grijalva (AZ-3), Brian Higgins (NY-26), John Larson (CT-3), Lloyd Doggett (TX-35), Dina Titus (NV-3), Dwight Evans (PA-3), Ro Khanna (CA-17), and Angie Craig (MN-2).

Watch my speech here . Congresswoman Tlaib at the DACA protest in front of the Capitol . Haiti Unjust Deportations In the midst of the crisis in Haiti, it is clear that the United States must halt all deportations to Haiti and provide their citizens already in the U.S. with safety and status. Deporting people to Haiti in the middle of this crisis goes against everything Democrats claim to stand for, yet- 25,000 people have been deported to Haiti this year alone . I joined my colleagues in calling the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to designate Haiti for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in light of the ongoing violence and political upheaval there. People arriving in the United States from certain countries may be granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) when deporting them to their country of origin poses a threat to that person's security. TPS is granted when the person's home country is experiencing difficulties or conflicts that make returning untenable, or a direct threat to the wellbeing and safety of that person. Club Q and Pulse Survivors Last week, I got the meet the beautiful and powerful survivors of the anti-LGBTQ+ attacks at Club Q and Pulse nightclub. I am so grateful to them for speaking their truth. Every single person should be able to live their lives without fear of violence. LGBTQ+ rights are human rights , and I am committed to ensuring we our LGBTQ+ neighbors are safe and protected. Watch the committee hearing here . Congresswoman Tlaib at the Capitol with Club Q and Pulse survivors. Student Loan Relief President Biden's student education debt relief program has been temporarily blocked by recent court orders. The White House is seeking to overturn those orders, and the issue will be heard by the Supreme Court. As a result, at this time, applications are NOT being accepted, but if you've already applied, your application is being held on file. The student education loan payment pause has been extended until the Department of Education is permitted to implement the debt relief program or the litigation is resolved. If the debt relief program has not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June 30, 2023 , payments will resume 60 days after that. We will keep you informed as further updates are available. In the District: Residents in the Core City neighborhood of Detroit have been organizing opposition to a proposed concrete crushing facility that will bring toxic dust, air pollution, and heavy truck traffic to their community. Last week, our office attended a community meeting and press conference in support of residents who shared their stories and voiced their concerns about how the concrete facility would hurt their quality of life. Core City residents protesting a toxic concrete crushing plant that could pollute their neighborhood. Notable Votes: Last week Congress voted on the following critical bills: H.R. 8393 - Puerto Rico Status Act This bill will establish a plebiscite in Puerto Rico, where the people of Puerto Rico will choose between three options for decolonizing the island - Statehood, Independence, and Sovereignty in Free Association with the United States. The bill describes how each of these three non-territory political status options will be implemented and the implications of each, so that voters can make an informed decision about their political future. The bill requires Congress to implement the will of the voters and the result of the plebiscite. If it were to pass the Senate and be signed into law, it would begin the long overdue process of decolonizing Puerto Rico after 120 years as a U.S. territory whose people have limited rights and access to resources. The Puerto Rico Status Act is the result of months of negotiations in the House Natural Resources Committee between Reps. Velazquez, Ocasio-Cortez, Soto, and Gonzalez-Colon, as they developed a compromise bill that included pieces of their own legislation, H.R. 1522, the Puerto Rico Statehood Admission Act, and H.R. 2070, the Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act of 2021. I voted yes on H.R. 8393 because I believe it is important to show Congressional support for empowering Puerto Ricans to end their colonial status and choose a new political future. However, I recognize that the bill is not perfect, and the process that created it should have included more public deliberations accessible and responsive to the Puerto Rican people. If this bill is not signed into law this term, I hope future versions of the bill will be responsive to continued feedback from Puerto Ricans on the island and across the diaspora. Our Statements and Letters: Tlaib Introduces Restaurant Workers Bill of Rights to Improve the Lives of Restaurant Workers Nationwide WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (MI-13) introduced House Resolution 1528, the Restaurant Workers Bill of Rights, in partnership with worker members of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United, recognizing restaurant workers' rights to thriving wages, healing, rest, a safe and dignified working environment, universal health care, bodily autonomy, and democracy in their workplace. ""No one should have to worry about paying rent at the end of the month or making ends meet because they can't rely on consistent tips and lack paid sick leave,"" said Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib. ""Our restaurant workers simply want an opportunity to thrive-not just survive-and deserve a safe, dignified working environment. No worker should be exploited, retaliated against, or denied benefits, especially for organizing for better working conditions and a better quality of life. Access to health care should not be a privilege tied to your employment, but a basic human right."" ""As a lifelong organizer who has fought for the rights of restaurant workers, and a 9/11 survivor who worked as a prep-cook, cook and sous chef at the Windows on the World at World Trade Center, I know that we must do far more than simply going out to the streets with our signs and placards. We must reverse the harmful, unfair policies that severely affect low-wage restaurant workers-and the Restaurant Workers Bill of Rights is the answer to address the job quality crisis faced by most restaurant workers,"" said Dr. Sekou Siby, President and CEO of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United. ""The ongoing system in our restaurant industry has been broken for decades, with millions of restaurant workers earning as low as $2.13 per hour since 1991- and no health insurance and paid leave benefits that protect them and their children. We must finally reform it in the most equitable and effective way that focuses on life, liberty, respect, dignity, family and opportunities for all restaurant workers, no matter what their race, skin color, or gender identity is."" ""2023 will mark the 63rd year anniversary of the Greensboro, NC sit-in protests against racism in American restaurants. Since then, laws have changed, but the practice of treating workers differently based on race is still widely practiced in the restaurant industry,"" said Tanya Wallace-Gobern, Executive Director of the National Black Worker Center. ""It is past time - way past time, to ensure that restaurant workers have the right to safe and dignified work where they are free from discrimination and harassment. This resolution protecting the rights of restaurant workers strengthens the civil rights movement work of the 1960's."" ""I can't express enough how grateful and honored I am that the Restaurant Workers Bill of Rights was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, who is a native of Detroit, like me, and has spent all her life in the state of Michigan,"" said Crystal Coleman, a restaurant worker in Detroit, Michigan. ""Even when I work long hours, I still have to rely on state Medicaid, just for us to be protected in case I or one of my children gets sick. I am also on food stamps. I would have not experienced these hardships if the Restaurant Workers Bill of Rights was already in place. It's time to call on Congress! We now need our representatives to vote for this resolution and start advancing the policies that are outlined in the Restaurant Workers Bill of Rights. We have been waiting for far too long!"" Restaurant workers have gone unvalued and exploited for far too long, and the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated systemic issues in their workplace. As a result, hospitality workers began organizing for better working conditions and demanding the right to collectively bargain, but companies like Starbucks and Chipotle are illegally retaliating against workers by closing stores and denying their employees benefits. According to a ROC United survey, which included responses from more than 1,000 restaurant workers, 85 percent experienced wage loss, 91 percent did not receive hazard pay or increased pay for working during the pandemic, 34 percent had no access to protective equipment such as masks or gloves, and 1 in 10 workers was forced to go to work while COVID-positive due to pressure from their employer or the lack of paid sick leave. As a result, 60 percent reported that they are looking for work outside of the industry. Through a comprehensive framework, the Restaurant Workers Bill of Rights addresses the challenges that restaurant workers face every day- the majority of whom are women, people of color, and immigrants. This legislation is cosponsored by Reps. Jesús ""Chuy"" García (D-IL) and Marie Newman (D-IL). The Restaurant Workers Bill of Rights is also endorsed by National Black Worker Center; Family Values @ Work; National Employment Law Project; East Biloxi Community Collaborative; Jobs to Move America; Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP); PowerSwitch Action; Catch Fire Movement For All; MS Black Women's Roundtable; Paid Leave for All Action; Steps Coalition; Main Street Alliance; National Immigration Law Center; Americans for Democratic Action (ADA); Shriver Center on Poverty Law; A Better Balance; Oxfam America; and Jobs with Justice.

387," News from Representative Ryan AGENCY HELP REQUEST AN APPEARANCE NEWS RELEASES Dear  , Wishing a happy Hanukkah to those who celebrate, and a happy start to the beginning of the holiday season for all! As we march toward the New Year, I wanted to give an update on a very productive week. HAVE A QUESTION ON YOUR MIND? Then join my first Telephone Town Hall tomorrow at 8:00pm! I'll be talking about my first few months in Congress and taking questions from constituents. If you'd like to join, call 877-295-7746 or go to HOLDING CENTRAL HUDSON ACCOUNTABLE In March, I called on the NY Public Service Commission (PSC) to investigate Central Hudson's disgraceful business practices. Last Thursday, the PSC filed a report alleging that Central Hudson demanded unjust and unreasonable charges to thousands of customers and failed to provide adequate service. This is a resounding victory for the people of the Hudson Valley, who for too long have been the victim of corporate greed and gross incompetence from Central Hudson. I will not stop fighting until they are held accountable for their actions. And if you have an unresolved billing or utility services issue, please fill out this form and my team will share your concern directly with you the New York State Attorney General, the Public Service Commission, and Central Hudson. HONORING OUR PACT TO VETERANS On Friday, I joined the Hudson Valley VA and leaders of veteran's organizations from across the region for a PACT Act Week of Action event. This crucial legislation ensures that the up to 3.5M veterans who were exposed to toxic chemicals can access the health care services they need. This is personal- having served two combat tours in Iraq, I just signed up for coverage myself. To my fellow veterans, regardless of separation date or previous eligibility, please visit to apply for these earned benefits. CONTINUING TO DELIVER FOR THOSE WHO SERVED Last week, I was honored to help pass the VA Employee Fairness Act. This bill gives VA healthcare workers the same collective bargaining rights as private providers. This is a big win for VA healthcare workers, and a big win for our veterans, who deserve access to the best possible care. I am also proud to announce that my bill, the Expanding Home Loans for Guard and Reservists Act, was introduced in the Senate by Senator Jeanne Shaheen , bringing it one step closer to becoming law. Regardless of where they are deployed, our service members deserve every benefit they have earned. CONGRATULATIONS TO SGT. MULLEN! A well-deserved shoutout to SGT. Mullen of the Ulster County's Sheriff's Office, who completed the elite and selective FBI National Academy. The Ulster County Sheriff's Office is truly the best of the best, and I know he will continue to serve this county with honor.

388," Our nation is in the midst of a surge of illegal immigration as a result of the administration's attempt to end the Title 42 public health order. Title 42 extended: crisis averted, for now Hello  , ﻿ Our nation is in the midst of a surge of illegal immigration as a result of the administration's attempt to end the Title 42 public health order. Title 42 grants our Border Patrol and U.S. Customs the authority to expel immigrants to their country of last transit who pose a health risk, either by virtue of being subject to previously announced travel restrictions or because they unlawfully entered the country to bypass health screening measures. Fortunately, the Supreme Court recently placed a last-minute temporary freeze on Title 42, allowing it to remain in place for now. This is not a permanent border solution, however, and the administration must act immediately to correct the lawlessness occurring at our southern border. Title 42 has been an invaluable tool for law enforcement agencies who are facing an unprecedented surge in illegal immigration. According to US Customs and Border Protection data, authorities have expelled nearly 2.5 million migrants at the southern border in less than three years under Title 42, more than 80% of which have occurred under the current administration. Although immigrants have always been a key part of our culture as a ""melting pot"" and have greatly contributed to our national development, the United States is also a country that believes deeply in the rule of law. Unfortunately, America's immigration system has long been broken and is desperately in need of reform. This crisis at our southern border makes it more critical than ever for our government to take prompt action in support of our Border Patrol agents to stop the influx of illegal immigrants and illicit drugs into our community. Learn More Here ICYMI: My recent appearance on Fox News In case you missed it, I appeared on Fox News Live on Saturday to discuss what we can expect with the end of Title 42, along with other news of the day, including Leader Kevin McCarthy's bid for House Speaker. I have joined my colleagues in supporting efforts to fund completion of the border wall, and I am pushing the President to both reverse his harmful border policies and provide support to our local law enforcement in addressing the problems our community faces as a result of our open borders. Here in San Bernardino County, we've experienced an over 600% increase in fentanyl-related overdose deaths as a direct result of the illicit drugs coming across the southern border. I will continue fighting to secure our borders and to stop the flow of drug and human trafficking into our communities. Watch the full interview by clicking below. Watch Here Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act I recently voted in favor of H.R. 7776, the FY23 NDAA, to support America's military and continue to bolster our national security and critical programs at the Department of Defense. The bill also importantly included a 4.6 percent annual raise for our hardworking servicemembers that will help their families stave off the devastating impacts of inflation. The chief responsibility and original mandate of the federal government is to guarantee our national security and ensure the readiness of our armed forces in their confrontation with emerging and increasingly hostile threats to American security. I am committed to supporting our military servicemembers and veterans and enhancing the security of our country. California's 8 th District is the proud home of six military installations and nearly 50,000 veterans, and I will continue fighting to ensure they receive the support they deserve. Defending our rural communities Last week I supported S. 2796, the Rural Opioid Abuse Prevention Act, to increase eligibility for a Justice Department opioid grant program to bolster community response programs in rural areas like ours where we've seen a 656% increase in fentanyl related deaths. Grants like this will help our community combat this deadly crisis and keep our children safe. More Here More Here What matters to you?

389," Dear Friend, This week, I'm in Washington working with my colleagues to pass an appropriations bill that will support New Mexico priorities. Stay tuned for more information on how this deal will help New Mexicans. This Holiday season, I also want to say thank you to every New Mexican who has kept me in their prayers this year. I have never stopped fighting for New Mexicans - and I never will. It's been a busy and challenging year for many New Mexicans. Communities across the state continue to recover from historic wildfires and flooding that devastated our families and businesses. It's why I worked with President Biden and my colleagues in Congress to secure $2.5 billion for New Mexicans to rebuild from the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire. There is still more work to do to help make New Mexicans whole, and I will continue working with all stakeholders to make this happen. That's not all that happened this year. Congress passed historic legislation to lower prescription drug prices and combat the climate crisis through the Inflation Reduction Act; a significant expansion of benefits and services for veterans suffering from toxic exposure and burn pits through the PACT Act; and investments in New Mexico's National Laboratories through the CHIPS and Science Act. In 2023, I will continue working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to create new jobs and grow the economy, support our veterans, and invest in science, technology, and innovation. Recently, I sat down with the Albuquerque Journal to recap the year and preview what comes next. Read the story here and below: Albuquerque Journal - U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján's year of change He stood up to top Democrats in order to funnel money to New Mexico and recovered from a stroke. 2022 was quite the year for Sen. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M. After serving 12 years in the U.S. House, rising to the rank of assistant House Democratic leader, Luján said he's finding his stride as a first-term senator, whose term started in 2021. The bills he was able to push through Congress will have an impact on the lives of New Mexicans, he said. But Luján could have died this year. On Jan. 27, he woke up dizzy at his home in Nambé. At first, Luján paced around his home, drank some water and lay back down. Thankfully, he woke up again 15 minutes later. ""And the room went from spinning like a merry-go-round to spinning on its side,"" he said in an interview last week. Luján called his chief of staff and primary care physician, who advised him to go to the hospital. The senator's family lives near him. His sister, Jackie, drove him to a fire station, and he was then taken by ambulance to Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center in Santa Fe before he was transferred to the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. He had suffered a stroke in his cerebellum and underwent surgery to relieve the swelling. A little more than two weeks later, Luján posted a video to social media of him and his doctors. He said he would soon be returning to the narrowly divided Senate. He received a bipartisan standing ovation when he returned to the chamber five weeks after his stroke. How did the event change him? ""I'm much more careful now, just in general. And I think some of that may be the stroke and the other part is because I turned 50 this year, man,"" he said. ""Some of my mountain bike routines were probably a little more aggressive than they should have been. So I'm just trying to be smarter about stuff."" When he returned to Washington, D.C., Luján said he continued to recover by regularly walking about 15 minutes to work from his apartment. He also credited his close friends, who include Sens. Corey Booker, Alex Padilla and Brian Schatz, and Interior Secretary Deb Haaland. ""I never lost cognitive ability,"" he said. ""I never lost my ability to speak."" The stroke didn't define Luján's year. The son of longtime state lawmaker Ben Lujan, New Mexico's junior senator said his leadership experience in the House allowed him to get a running start in the Senate. ""It was important for me this cycle, with the success I have legislatively, to lean on my colleagues here in the Senate, but also my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives, who helped me move legislation,"" he said. He developed a reputation as a behind-the-scenes mover and shaker. ""I'm often surprised with a number of my colleagues here in the Senate that will call me up to ask for ideas or advice or even invite me into the room for strategy because of the work I did in the House,"" he said. Some of his legislative highlights of 2022 include the Hermit's Peak Fire Assistance Act. The bill was included in a continuing resolution passed in September and it devotes $2.5 billion to New Mexico to help the state recover from the largest wildfire in state history, which started when two Forest Service prescribed burns got out of control and merged. The bill was included in a larger spending bill that received bipartisan support. But Luján said he at one point threatened top Democrats that he would obstruct the party's other priorities if it wasn't signed into law. ""That probably was the example within the last year of using all relationships and being willing to use every motion and privilege on the floor that I knew about to tell not only the Democratic leadership in the Senate, but also the White House, that I will go and do everything I can. I will obstruct. I will slow things down,"" he said. ""This has to (pass) because the federal government started this."" He also secured additional funding for New Mexico's national labs, which was included in the CHIPS and Science Act signed into law this year. Looking forward, Luján said he remains optimistic for Democrats moving into the 118th Congress, which begins next year. The party will lose control of the House. ""I'm optimistic,"" Luján said. ""I believe we'll accomplish a great deal throughout the Senate, and we'll find ways to compromise and work with the House.""

391," Counting down top accomplishments over a decade of service Dear friend, As I prepare to leave Congress, I'm highlighting some of my top accomplishments during the last decade. When it comes to infrastructure, I've been proud to bring home millions in taxpayer dollars to invest in Illinois roads, bridges and airports. Our highways in Northwest, Northern and Central Illinois span thousands of miles that connect towns and major cities. That's why I helped lead a bipartisan effort to pass the first long-term highway bill in a decade. This legislation provided Illinois with $7.5 billion over the next five years to fund highway, transit and transportation safety programs across the state. Northwestern, Northern and Central Illinois are home to three international airports and multiple regional airfields, and I always worked to support these airports. In addition to millions in federal funding delivered over the years, I secured $15 million to construct a new air traffic control tower at the General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport , founded the bipartisan Congressional Air Cargo Caucus to support Rockford's growing air cargo industry and delivered $3 million in grants to improve the Quad-Cities Airport drainage system . Last year, I was also proud to bring home the most community project funding of any House Democrat, totaling $56 million! These funds help address critical projects in our communities, including $1.2 million for updates to the Galesburg Sanitary District's Wastewater Treatment Plant, $45.1 million for modernizing a lock on the Upper Mississippi River System and $4.5 million for a climate resilience and biomanufacturing initiative at Peoria's Ag Lab. And this past Congress, I championed the largest investment in infrastructure our nation has seen in generations when the bipartisan infrastructure law was enacted. Together, we have met many challenges and successes. As I prepare to close a decade of service, it is my hope that these historic investments in our infrastructure will prepare Illinois for a bright future.

Committee Update Last Wednesday, the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade held a hearing to discuss trade policy. The Democrat Majority - along with the Biden Administration - has taken an anemic approach to bolstering America's trade presence in global markets. The Ways and Means Committee - which has jurisdiction over America's domestic and international trade policy - has held only 8 hearings total relating to trade in the past 2 years. America is a leader in the global economy and we cannot sit idly by as the rest of the world advances without us. The Ways and Means committee should be focused on growing market access for American businesses to compete in, not following this administration's example of a lackluster pursuit of any substantive trade policy. We have seen how important and effective strong trade policy is for Georgia's local communities. As a result of trade agreements opening new markets for American exporters, forestry has become the number one industry in our state. In the Third District alone, privately owned timberlands generate over a billion dollars in sales and manufacturing, making it a vital component of our local economy. We should build on that success by furthering global trade agreements to access new markets, reinstate successful programs like the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) that many Georgia companies utilize, not hinder it with overbearing regulations or inaction. Along with the need to engage with other countries to pursue free trade agreements, I discussed the need for strong intellectual property protections to safeguard American innovators and businesses. Handing over hard-earned American innovation and technology is simply wrong and puts foreign competitors first. This administration has failed to pursue any beneficial trade policy or actions that would benefit the United States, create more jobs here at home, or allow American innovation and competitiveness to reach its full potential. The Ways and Means Committee would be better served holding a hearing to focus on renewing GSP and MTB which would allow market access for our U.S. exporters, lead to more jobs, and help our struggling economy on the brink of an economic recession. Click here to watch my remarks during the hearing. Season Greetings May your home be filled with peace, joy, and love this holiday season! I'm so grateful for each and every one of you who make our Third District community such a wonderful place to call home. It has always been my mission to represent you in a way that makes you proud - by the way I conduct myself, by making thoughtful decisions, and by exhibiting the strength of character that you expect in the person who represents you.

It's hard to believe that it's already this time of year again! As I've done in previous years, I have put together an End of Term Report detailing what I've been working on as your representative. I hope you join us in reflecting on all we've accomplished over the past two years and the work that remains ahead. We kicked off 2021 with the American Rescue Plan that put shots in arms, kids back in school and our economy back on track. We finished this term with the Inflation Reduction Act , historic legislation that lowers prescription drug prices, invests in our climate, and is paid for by forcing billion-dollar corporations to finally pay what they owe. Along the way, we passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law , the CHIPS Act , the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act , the Respect for Marriage Act and so much more. This report breaks down all we've accomplished so you can better understand how it will benefit you and families across our district. It's the honor of a lifetime to serve the district that has given me so much, and I look forward to continuing our work together in the new year.

Christmas carolers made their way through the halls of Congress recently - and I happily welcomed them to my office. The carolers hailed from Bruderhof's Spring Valley and New Meadow Run School in Farmington, Pennsylvania, and made their way throughout the Capitol to offices in our congressional delegation. As Christmas fast approaches, I hope your season is filled with holiday cheer and plenty of family time. The Forgotten American Prisoner Last week, it was unbelievable to watch President Biden's prisoner swap celebration while Pittsburgh teacher Marc Fogel remains locked up in Russia. In his remarks, Biden failed even to mention Fogel's name . Congress must investigate the negotiation process that brought Griner home but left Fogel and former Marine Paul Whelan in Russia. Electing to trade only a celebrity basketball player for a notorious Russian international arms dealer - while Fogel and Whelan remain in Russia - warrants heavy scrutiny. I'll get to the bottom of this disaster and stop at nothing to bring Fogel and Whelan home. Honoring our Purple Heart Recipients The Purple Heart medal is our nation's oldest military award and recognizes the sacrifices of service members who suffered combat wounds and death. In this year's National Defense Authorization Act , I am proud to have secured language to require each military service branch to ensure that a publicly available website includes a link to a description of the background of the Purple Heart, the eligibility criteria for awarding the Purple Heart, and contact information for each service's awards and decorations branch. This legislation is critical to honor the service and sacrifice of Purple Heart recipients and assist veterans service organizations attempting to identify individuals most in need of their resources. Supporting Mission-Readiness for the Air National Guard For nearly 75 years, the 171st Air Refueling Wing from southwestern PA helped to protect the United States and its allies in the skies - including being one of the first units activated after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Last week, the House of Representatives passed the National Defense Authorization Act , which included my bipartisan language to support the top-notch capabilities of the Air National Guard's refueling mission. Air Guardsmen from across our nation, including the 171st Air Refueling Wing, play a critical role in meeting national objectives, enhancing global reach and power, and supporting ongoing operations. As a Navy veteran, I will always support the men and women who sacrifice everything for our nation.

397," News from Rep. Chip Roy CONTACT ABOUT ISSUES MEDIA SERVICES Dear  , As I begin another busy week in Texas and Washington, I wanted to pass along my latest update on what I have been doing to fight for you, Texas' 21st Congressional district, and our country as a whole: Fighting Dems' last-ditch omnibus spending spree Last week, I spoke on the House floor to urge all Republicans - especially Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell - to do their jobs, follow the wishes of the American people who gave a majority to Republicans in the House of Representatives, and block Dems' reportedly trillion-dollar omnibus spending bill. You can watch my floor speech last week by clicking here. Over the weekend, I joined Fox News' Shannon Bream to break down how Biden's border crisis will become the McConnell-Republican border crisis if Republicans give the Biden administration more money this week without demanding that they secure the border. You can watch my Fox News interview by clicking here. Fighting to impeach Mayorkas and secure our border On Tuesday, I stood alongside several of my House Republican colleagues to demand that Biden's Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas be impeached. Mayorkas is purposefully endangering the American people and migrants who seek to come here, and Republicans must fight to remove him from office next Congress. You can watch my full remarks on impeaching Mayorkas by clicking here. Fighting to defund the Swamp's madness On Thursday, I and nine of my House colleagues introduced the House version of my friend Senator Ted Cruz's bill that would stop the District of Columbia from using federal funds to allow illegal aliens to vote in any election. This comes after the D.C. city government recently passed a measure that would allow illegal aliens to vote in local elections. The privilege and duty to vote in this Republic's elections is, and should remain , reserved for citizens. The D.C. Council's recent effort to allow non-citizens to vote is just another example of the radical left's insane and reckless governance of our nation's capital, which has also precipitated riots, lawlessness, and a homelessness crisis in recent years. You can read more about my bill by clicking here. Standing up for energy freedom On Thursday, I and 10 of my House Republican colleagues demanded the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reverse its decision to deny small refineries relief from the crony Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandate. A recent Government Accountability Office report found EPA based its decision to deny small refineries relief from the RFS on flawed, inaccurate, and unverified information and administers the relief exemptions in a wholly arbitrary manner. We urged EPA to immediately reverse its decision, improve its administration of the RFS, and reduce the program's burden on American refiners, workers, and families. You can read my full letter to EPA by clicking here. Honoring our veterans Team Roy participated in Wreaths Across America in Austin and Kerrville on Saturday morning. There was an outpouring of support from Texans honoring the lives of our veterans, from the American Revolution to today.

398," 96 Dear Texan, After a busy week, I wanted to take this opportunity to update you on what's happening in the U.S. House and Texas' 31st district. ON THE DOCKET: - Opening Two VA Clinics - Continuing Resolution - Secretary Mayorkas' Failures - Saying Farewell to our 2022 Fellows THE BRIEF: - The majority of adult Americans have reported experiencing financial hardship because of Bidenflation. - Border Patrol agents reported facing 14,000 illegal crossings at our southern border in the span of just 48 hours. - Electricity prices are expected to rise over 11% this winter. Representative Carter joins veterans, health care staff, and Central Texas Veterans Health Care System Director Michael Kiefer in cutting the ribbon for a new clinic in Copperas Cove. VA CLINICS OPEN FOR BUSINESS In 2019, I announced two new VA clinics coming to Killeen and Copperas Cove. After significant COVID delays, these two clinics are operational and veterans are getting care they need in a more accessible location. I heard from veterans in western Bell County that traveling to the Temple VA hospital often required long bus rides or full days off of work, so as the top Republican on the Veterans Affairs Subcommittee, I went to work years ago to find funding to open clinics in this area. It was fantastic to cut the ribbon on these two clinics today and see veterans come in to receive care. CONTINUING RESOLUTION While House Democrats approved a short-term funding bill to avoid a government shutdown, it failed to include Republican priorities to cut wasteful spending, reduce inflation, and prioritize border security and national defense. Texans deserve better! Congressman Carter joins Republican colleagues to discuss Mayorkas' failures at the border. SECRETARY MAYORKAS' FAILURES Every day Texans are impacted by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' failures at the southern border. Time and time again, he has chosen to allow chaos at the border resulting in Border Patrol agents, migrants, and Americans losing their lives. His inaction is a dereliction of duty. I stood alongside my Republican colleagues to send a clear message that Secretary Mayorkas must go and under a Republican majority, we will hold him accountable! I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU! The House passed a National Defense Authorization Act which included a provision that would roll back the vaccine mandate for service members. More than 8,000 active-duty service members were discharged for failure to obey a lawful order when they refused the vaccine. It is now being considered whether those discharged for not getting the vaccine should be reinstated. I want to know what you think. Take a moment to fill out the survey below. TX-31 Official Survey Do you believe that servicemembers discharged for not getting the vaccine should be reinstated? Yes No Other Taking this survey will sign you up for future news and updates from my office. Representative Carter says goodbye to his 2022 legislative fellows. SAYING FAREWELL TO OUR 2022 FELLOWS Shareia and KD have served in my office as fellows assisting with military construction, veteran affairs, and defense legislation. Their efforts have helped countless TX-31 veterans and active duty military. Join me in saying thank you for all their hard work over the last year!

We talked about soccer, my time at the United States Naval Academy, why I chose to pursue a political career, and how the Chips and Science Act originated in the Senate gym. You can listen to the conversation here . Supporting Our Troops, Responding to Global Threats Last week, I voted in favor of the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the annual legislative vehicle that authorizes all programs and spending for the Department of Defense (DoD). The bill passed the Senate 83-11 and will now head to the President's desk to be signed into law. At a time of increasing threats and heightened national security challenges, this critical bill takes big steps in putting the United States on a better trajectory to out-compete the Chinese Communist Party, invest in a 21st Century Arsenal of Democracy, and provide our brave men and women in uniform with the support they deserve. As passed, the NDAA provides our troops a 4.6 percent pay increase and proposes a 12 percent increase over last year's military budget, which will help support our military during the worst inflation in decades. The NDAA passed with four key provisions I worked on including: The retirement of Air Force A-10 fighter jets which will allow the 122nd Fighter Wing in Fort Wayne to transition from the A-10 to the F-16. Bipartisan Burma provisions which will support the efforts of the National Unity Government to reform Burma's constitution, support the restoration of the legitimate government, and hold the Burmese military and its international backers accountable for their crimes. Hypersonic weapon research reporting requirements which will ensure that academic and private-sector partners are not overlooked in the DoD's efforts to field an effective hypersonic weapon. The Great Lakes Winter Commerce Act which will ensure the Coast Guard is adequately tracking icy conditions on the Great Lakes, working with Great Lakes stakeholders, and resourcing the acquisition of new, capable icebreakers.

Last week was eventful in Washington, D.C. and back home in the sixth district. Below, please find an update of my most recent work. My Floor Speech on Deficit and Spending Last week I went to the House floor to discuss the accelerating government debt crisis facing our nation. Mandatory spending and interest have exploded. Medicare and Social Security are responsible for nearly every dime of government borrowing over the next 30 years. Addressing the shortfalls expected in each program demands urgent conversations about the math and will require bold, disruptive solutions. Rest assured, I will continue to problem solve with my colleagues in the Senate and on Ways and Means to ensure future generations receive the earned benefits and high-quality healthcare they deserve. Click on the image above to watch my full floor speech. Happy 100th Birthday, Sgt. Metcalfe! This past weekend, I was blessed with the opportunity to spend time with Sgt. Eugene Metcalfe at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post in Fountain Hills to celebrate his 100th Birthday. Sgt. Metcalfe joined the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment in 1942. He was among the first to jump from a C-47 over Groesbeek Heights, about 45 miles behind enemy lines. Sgt. Metcalfe's incredible story is chronicled by Marcus Nannini's book, Left for Dead at Nijmegen: The True Story of an American Paratrooper . It is always an honor to recognize and celebrate veterans, especially those who reach centennial milestones like Eugene. Please join me in congratulating Sgt. Metcalfe on reaching this momentous milestone! Don't Give Gifts to Scammers Many of us spend the holidays relaxing and sharing in goodwill with friends and family. However, some bad actors use the holidays to take advantage of their generous neighbors. Scammers frequently target the older and other more vulnerable members of our communities. They pretend they are from Social Security and government agencies to steal money, personal information, or both. It's critical to know what to look for and be alert. If you receive a questionable call, text, or email, hang up or don't respond. You should report the attempt by clicking the image above.

401," ENEWS SIGN UP | WEBSITE Dear  , Happy Holidays! I hope you and your loved ones are taking care, especially after last week's tornadoes. My heart is with all those who are suffering from this disaster. If you haven't already, please report any damage you may have sustained here . Additionally, if my office can be of any assistance, never hesitate to reach out . The holiday season is an important opportunity to reflect on what's most important: our family, our health, our freedom, and our way of life. Today I want to take a moment to thank our veterans who defend these most previous things - and show my thanks with action. I've long been concerned about the terrible risks toxic exposures have posed to the health and wellbeing of our community, both here at home and for our service members abroad. Our veterans, and their families, have stood up and given so much for our nation during their service-we must fight for them now. That's why I supported the First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act. This new law ensures veterans suffering from the effects of toxic exposures due to their service-including exposure to burn pits, asbestos, and other toxins-will now be eligible for the health care and benefits they've earned and deserve. To help Louisiana's veterans navigate through this new process, I want to make sure you're aware of the resources available to veterans who can and should benefit from PACT Act provisions, more details can be found on the VA's website , where you can also apply for benefits. Veterans Affairs offices are set to begin processing most PACT Act-related benefits claims on January 1st, the earliest date possible, but don't wait to apply! If you apply for PACT Act-related benefits before August 10th of next year, then your benefits will be backdated to August 10, 2022. To find a Veteran Services Officer by county to help work through your claims, please visit the Louisiana Department of Veteran's Affairs . I encourage everyone eligible to get their claims in as soon as you can, and I hope you'll join me in spreading the word to all veterans you know. It's long past time for these brave men and women receive the benefits and care they deserve. Toxins also have no place in our communities at home. I'll keep fighting every day in Congress for the resources and laws to ensure clean air, clean water, and healthy communities in southeast Louisiana. Sincerely, Troy A.

402," Congressman Mark DeSaulnier (CA11) Working to restore trust and confidence in representative government --> Dear  : As the 117th Congress comes to an end and we look ahead to the new year, I have been reflecting on all Democrats in Congress and the Biden Administration have accomplished to support American families. As we celebrate the holidays, I am grateful ever for the opportunity to continue this work on behalf of you and your family in 2023. Thank you, and Happy Holidays! Sincerely, Mark DeSaulnier Member of Congress LEGISLATIVE UPDATE Congressman DeSaulnier Leads House Debate Congressman DeSaulnier had the honor of managing debate on the House Floor twice last week. First, he presented legislation to support health care workers and veterans, fund the government, and increase access to mental health crisis response. Later, he led debate on a bipartisan bill that would bring much needed transparency to federal contracting to prevent conflicts of interests and corporate abuse. You can watch both clips by clicking the images below. DeSaulnier Joins Colleagues to Introduce Bill to Support Cancer Survivors As an 8-year survivor of a non-curable treatable blood cancer, support for cancer survivors is personal to Congressman DeSaulnier. Along with Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Congressman DeSaulnier led introduction of the Comprehensive Cancer Survivorship Act (H.R. 9565). This bill would raise standards of care for cancer survivors and invest in policies that promote their quality of life. Included in this bill is Congressman DeSaulnier's Cancer Care Planning and Communications Act, which would allow doctors to bill Medicare for the time they spend working on health care plans for cancer patients and survivors. Congressman DeSaulnier supported House passage of other important legislation last week, including: VA Employee Fairness Act (H.R. 1948), which would restore full collective bargaining rights for VA healthcare professionals, such as registered nurses, physicians, dentists, and physician assistants. Puerto Rico Status Act (H.R. 8393), which would provide a path for the people of Puerto Rico to seek statehood if they wanted. Law Enforcement De-Escalation Training Act (S. 4003), which would require the development of trainings for law enforcement and mental health professionals on effective de-escalation tactics, alternatives to uses of force, safely responding to an individual experiencing a mental or behavioral health crisis, and making referrals to appropriate programs and services. Further Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act (H.R. 1437), which funded the government for a week to give congressional negotiators more time to develop a long-term government funding bill. IN THE COMMUNITY Contra Costa Joins National Wreaths Across America Day Our office joined Wreaths Across America events in Alamo and Concord to commemorate those who laid down their lives in service to our nation. It was an honor to participate in this tradition honoring our veterans and their reflecting on their legacy. Celebrating Delano Johnson Delano Johnson is a community activist and founder of the nonprofit organization Bay Point Community All-N-One. Under his leadership, the organization serves countless East County families, providing them with housing, food, clothing, and other essential resources. Our office had the pleasure of joining the community to celebrate Delano's 80 th birthday and to reflect on his achievements. Congressman DeSaulnier Hosts Service Academy Interviews Each year Congressman DeSaulnier has the opportunity to nominate outstanding individuals who are hoping to join a U.S. military academy. We are grateful to our panel of experts for helping to interview this year's candidates. IN THE NEWS DeSaulnier and Democrats Fight to Keep Government Open This week, Congressman DeSaulnier took to the House Floor to help ensure passage of legislation that would keep the government open and working on behalf of the American people. Despite Republican opposition to the effort, House Democrats were able to avert a government shutdown. You can learn more about this process by clicking here or on the image below.

Supporting Our Military Men and Women The strength and preparedness of our military is a direct deterrent to our adversaries. Making certain our men and women in uniform have cutting-edge technology, an arsenal of advanced weapons and ample support for military families will determine the long-term success of our military. These provisions will also help overcome our military's current recruiting crisis by acting as a way to attract and retain talented young men and women who desire to serve their country. On Thursday night, the Senate passed the FY2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to give our troops the largest pay raise in 20 years, resupply our depleted weapons stock and make certain servicemembers have the equipment they need to complete their missions. As Russia continues its unjust war in Ukraine and China remains our foremost threat, it's critical that Congress provides the resources necessary for our military to be combat-ready. Wins for Kansas in the NDAA: ● Authorizes funding to support the construction of an unaccompanied enlisted barracks at Fort Riley. ● Authorizes funding for the construction of a microgrid at Fort Riley, increasing the resiliency of energy supply in the event of natural or man-made power outages. ● Allows for more veterans to lead Junior ROTC programs across the country. This reduces certain barriers for more programs to be stood up in Kansas, which is an underrepresented state by the Junior ROTC program. The NDAA also includes many of my other priorities: ● Requires that certain military equipment, such as body armor and protective gear, be manufactured in the U.S by small businesses. ● Requires a report detailing the operational impact on the National Defense Strategy of Tactical Control Party specialists force structure in the Air National Guard prior to the divestment of any units. ● Requires the Secretary of Defense to report on current alternatives to burn pits and ongoing efforts to field additional technologies. Joining Legislation to Help Resettle Afghan Refugees This week, I sponsored the Afghan Adjustment Act . The withdrawal from Afghanistan was a dark day in American history. The rushed and chaotic evacuation from Kabul resulted in the deaths of American servicemembers and stranded thousands of our Afghan allies behind enemy lines. For two decades countless Afghans stood by our servicemembers and risked their lives and their families' lives to support our troops in Afghanistan. Veterans of the Afghan War are now calling for Congress to provide safety and certainty for their allies and friends who assisted them in battle. We must answer that call and establish a pathway for our Afghan partners to begin a new life. In the months following the collapse of Afghanistan, thousands of Americans, Afghans and foreign nationals sought refuge from the Taliban. The U.S. assisted in the evacuation of thousands of Afghans to the U.S. and other countries. This legislation will put a program in place to protect our national security while also keeping our promise to those who risked their lives for America. The legislation has received the endorsement of veteran organizations including the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), Veterans for Foreign Wars, the American Legion, Veterans for American Ideals, With Honor Action and the Association of Wartime Allies. ISG (ret.) Slade Deister of Leavenworth on the Afghan Adjustment Act: Introducing Legislation to Address Nationwide Shortage in Aviation Workforce I joined Senator Tammy Duckworth to introduce bipartisan legislation to address the nationwide shortage of airplane pilots, mechanics and other positions in our aviation workforce in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This bill would also work to strengthen the pipeline of pilots serving regional airports, including the five airports across Kansas participating in the Essential Air Service Program. The Aviation Workforce Development Enhancement Act would help expand the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)'s current Aviation Workforce Development Grant program by increasing annual funding for pilot development and mechanic development grants, as well as provide grant funding for aviation manufacturing workforce development. This legislation will work to make certain the pipeline of talent within the aviation industry will remain strong for years to come. The state of Kansas is renowned for its aviation industry, but it is only as strong as our workforce. Further investment into these important programs and expanding the eligibility to the aviation manufacturing sector will work to strengthen the talent pipeline and prevent disruptions within this important industry. Meeting with Lieutenant General John Healy This week, I met with Lieutenant General John Healy, Commander of Air Force Reserve Command and Chief of Air Force Reserve. Lieutenant General Healy has been in this role since August, and I appreciated the opportunity to speak with him about his priorities for our Air Force Reserve. We also discussed the importance of the 931st Air Refueling Wing at McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas, which plays an essential role in aircraft maintenance for the KC-46 Pegasus and the KC-135. Lieutenant General Healy also updated me on the Air National Guard's implementation of the MOMS Act , legislation I introduced to make certain that women serving in the National Guard and Reserve can take maternity leave without worrying about how it will affect their credible military service. I want to thank Lieutenant General Healy for meeting with me to update me on these important topics and for his leadership and service to our country. Attending NASA's 2022 Year in Review On Wednesday, I joined NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy to celebrate NASA's 2022 accomplishments and to reflect on the incredible progress we have seen in space exploration throughout the last year. I am proud to be at the forefront as the lead Republican on the Senate Commerce Subcommittee with jurisdiction over NASA. From the launch of Artemis I to seeing the images of the James Webb Space Telescope to the helicopter flying on Mars, the advancements made by NASA have been awe-inspiring, and I look forward to all that will be accomplished in the new year. Meeting with U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Alumni Association & Foundation This week, I had the opportunity to meet with the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) Alumni Association and Foundation. The USMMA is one of our five federal service academies tasked with the mission to serve our country's national security interests, and I appreciated the opportunity to receive an update from them. During our meeting, we discussed the need for investment in their infrastructure and taking steps to make certain all cadets have a safe, supportive environment free of harassment and assault. As a member of the USMMA Board of Visitors, I am committed to working with newly-appointed USMMA Superintendent Rear Admiral Nunan to support and advance the academy, its servicemembers and its mission. Speaking to National Business Aviation Association Board of Directors On Thursday morning, I spoke to the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) Board of Directors, which includes member companies such as Bombardier, Honeywell, Choice Hotels, Coca-Cola and many others. We discussed important issues ahead of the 118th Congress like FAA Reauthorization and my priorities within that legislation, including continued progression of the Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) industry; reducing the current FAA backlog; and expanding workforce initiatives for pilot and mechanic development grants, as well as provide grant funding for aviation manufacturing workforce development. I want to thank members of the NBAA Board of Directors for hosting me for this valuable conversation, as well as NBAA President, CEO and fellow Kansan, Ed Bolen for the invitation. Meeting with Kansans Hays and Russell It was great to meet with local leaders from Hays and Russell this week during their visit to Washington, D.C. I appreciate them for serving their communities and for taking the time to meet with me regarding the issues important to them - including water conservation. The meeting included Hays Mayor Mason Ruder, Russell Mayor Jim Cross, Hays City Manager Toby Dougherty, Russell City Manager Jon Quinday, Hays Commissioner Reese Barrick, Hays Director of Water Resources Jeff Crispin, Russell Councilmember Dustin Madden, Russell Councilmember Lonnie Whitten and Russell City Attorney Ken Cole. Kansas Department of Commerce On Wednesday, I met with Kansas Department of Commerce Broadband Development Director Jade Piros de Carvalho and other broadband stakeholders from the state. We discussed the importance of making certain Kansans have access to high-quality broadband service. We also spoke about my recently-introduced Broadband Grant Tax Treatment Act. This legislation makes certain federal dollars recently allocated for broadband deployment are not federally taxed. As the lead Republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee with jurisdiction over many federal broadband deployment programs, I remain committed to making certain Kansans are able to connect to high-quality broadband service, and I look forward to working with broadband leaders in the state to achieve this goal. Welcoming Odys Aviation to Wichita Before traveling to Washington, D.C. on Monday, I joined the Greater Wichita Partnership in welcoming Odys Aviation to the Air Capital of the World. I want to thank Jeff Fluhr and his team for their work to attract and retain quality businesses in the region and for showcasing all that Wichita has to offer. I also want to thank Odys Aviation CEO James Dorris for accepting my invitation to visit Wichita and learn about opportunities for future partnerships. Established in 2019 and headquartered in Long Beach, CA, Odys Aviation develops and builds vertical takeoff and landing aircraft for the world's busiest travel corridors. With a century of aviation manufacturing, development and research, Wichita has the workforce and innovation to be an asset to Odys Aviation, propelling our nation into a new era of aviation - advanced air mobility (AAM). As a member of the Commerce Committee with jurisdiction over civil aviation and co-chair of the Senate Aerospace Caucus, I have worked to make certain our country remains competitive within the AAM realm by enacting legislation into law that will help facilitate collaboration between federal agencies, industry and academia in this important and burgeoning sector. I look forward to working with both Odys Aviation and the Greater Wichita Partnership to explore future opportunities for partnerships between the local community and aviation industry.

404," Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window f The Webster Wire Listening to Floridians Dear Friends: Wednesday, I voted against the Continuing Resolution - a short term spending bill that funds the government through December 23rd. I have continuously called on my colleagues - Democrat and Republican alike - to return to a responsible and thorough process for developing the federal budget. I refuse to accept the Washington presumption that nothing in the budget can be cut in order to fund priorities without increasing the deficit. I promised my constituents that I would work hard to reduce government spending. I have done that by sponsoring legislation that would require a balanced federal budget, supporting the Budget Control Act and opposing budgets that reversed those spending cuts. I have reduced my office's budget - returning more than $4 million in taxpayer dollars - and I annually roll my salary back to the 2008 levels. If all federal government spending was rolled back to the 2008 amounts, we would no longer have a budget deficit and could begin to pay down our debts. I will continue fighting to reform Washington and oppose my colleagues' exorbitant and dangerous spending habit. I am confident we can set our nation on a responsible fiscal path while investing in critical priorities, including border security, infrastructure projects, and our military. It starts with Congress rejecting the practice of last-minute funding deals and policies that restrict economic growth. Bill Preventing FEMA Clawbacks to Become Law Last week, the Preventing Disaster Revictimization Act, a bill I introduced passed the Senate and is set to become law . This bill will ensure that innocent disaster victims won't be required to pay back their disaster assistance when the federal government has made an error, but no fraud was committed. Under current law, FEMA can come back weeks, months, or even years later to seek repayment of funds it awarded victims, even when the agency is at fault for making the error and the funds were appropriately used in the wake of a disaster. As Floridians, we know the devastating effects of hurricanes and natural disasters. Federal aid is critical for many and impacts their ability to recover and rebuild in the wake of disaster, this bill will protect victims and bring further accountability to FEMA. Transparency on the Origins of COVID-19 Understanding the origins of COVID-19, the mismanagement of the response that has led to countless crises, such as the loss of education for children and the mental health crises is crucial to improve actions in the future. Last week, Republicans on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released a report on the origins of COVID-19. Their findings show that there are serious shortcomings with the Intelligence Community's Updated Assessment on COVID-19 origins, and that important information was withheld, which likely skewed the public's understanding of key issues. Additionally, the House Oversight and Reform Committee has named 40 individuals it will seek to interview as part of its investigation on U.S. funded grants and research related to the Wuhan lab. These are all significant steps in the right direction and Republicans are committed to continuing this work next Congress. I have and will continue to support legislation that requires the Biden Administration to provide Congress declassified intelligence reports regarding the origins of COVID-19. The VA Needs More Accountability Not Less Thursday, I voted against H.R. 1948 because it hamstrings the VA Secretary's ability to ensure the highest quality of care for America's veterans. I am disappointed that Congress would attempt to transfer the responsibility of issues impacting patient care and clinical competence to unaccountable third-party arbitrators. We owe our veterans a debt we can never repay. I have and will continue to advocate to bring reform to the VA to ensure our veterans get the care they have earned. If your application for veteran benefits or services have been delayed and you need assistance with getting a response from the VA, please contact my office. We are here to serve you. Hurricane Nicole Recovery Assistance If you own a business or are a resident of Lake County that sustained damage between Nov 7-30, 2022 due to Hurricane Nicole, you may be eligible for a low-interest disaster loan from the SBA. Small businesses and many private nonprofit organizations in Sumter County that were impacted by Hurricane Nicole may be eligible for a SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan. Please visit SBA's secure website at and submit your application under SBA declaration # 17729. The filing deadline to return applications for physical property damage is Feb. 13, 2023. The deadline to return economic injury applications is Sept. 13, 2023. If you have questions or need assistance with this application or an update on an existing application, please contact my office at 352-241-9220. Seeing and Serving You On Saturday, I had the honor of again participating in the annual Wreaths Across America Ceremony at the Florida National Cemetery in Bushnell. Each December, Wreaths Across America honors our veterans as countless volunteers place Christmas wreaths at the headstones of our soldiers in national cemeteries across the U.S. This holiday season, join me in saying a prayer of thanks for the life that was lived in defense of our country and a prayer for those - and their loved ones - living today defending our country. _______________ Pam Jones and Cindy Brown, my Community Relations Representatives for The Villages and Sumter County, visited with the members of The Villages Friends of the Salvation Army Club. The Salvation Army Leesburg Brass Quartet played and Lt. Jeremy Porter, the Leesburg Corps Commanding Officer, received a check for $10,000 from the Club which were the proceeds from the annual ""Soup Off"" event held in November to support Salvation Army feeding programs. _______________ On Wednesday, Cindy visited The Wildwood Business Coalition's first Festive networking event at Great Lakes Carpet and Tile. The Wildwood Business Coalition is a newly formed organization of local Wildwood businesses who have come together for the benefits of economic revitalization, community outreach and bringing people into Wildwood to visit and shop. The event brought many businesses to support one another during a time of tremendous growth, and to celebrate the Holiday season. _______________ Pam Jones attended the ribbon cutting for the extended bus route of the Lake County Lake Express Bus Line with County Commissioners Doug Shields and Sean Parks. The new park and ride in the Four Corners travels to Clermont and across Route 50 from Mascotte to Winter Garden. _______________ On Friday, Cindy attended the Marion County Children's Alliance (MCCA) Executive Director Beth McCall and volunteers for the annual Holiday Gift Wrapping Campaign in the Ocala Paddock Mall. All proceeds went to benefit victims and survivors of domestic violence and support the Family Violence Prevention Workgroup of MCCA. _______________ Pam recently participated as a judge at the Future Farmers of America (FFA) Sub-Districts Contest with Erin Munz, Sumter County FFA Agent. The contest hosted Middle and High school students from across the district to build critical thinking and effective decision-making skills while competing in career and leadership development contests. _______________ Cindy also joined with Wildwood Police Chief Randy Palmer, Sgt. Perry, and Wildwood City Manager Jason McHugh for the kickoff of ""Shop with a Cop"" at the Walmart in Oxford. This special event, sponsored by the Wildwood Police Department and supported by their fundraisers, were able to provide 60 children, accompanied by a police officer, with $300 to spend on Christmas gifts for themselves and their family members. Thank you to the Wildwood Police Department for sponsoring this event and bringing much joy and excitement to children in the community! _______________ Pam also attended the Leesburg Chamber Ribbon Cutting for the New Season Treatment Center with Executive Director Sandi Moore. This is the 26th Center that has opened in the State of Florida. CEO Jim Shaheen was delighted to welcome chamber members and the community as he illustrated the services New Season offers to those working to overcome drug addiction.

405," News from Representative Carson WEBSITE | CONTACT ME Forward to a Friend December 19, 2022 Dear Friend, This was a monumental year for bringing progress and change directly to hardworking Americans. The Inflation Reduction Act was passed this year, a sweeping, transformative bill to lower the deficit, reduce inflation, slash prescription drug costs, and lower the cost of health care. I was proud to vote for this legislation, which helps the U.S. builds a new climate economy - moving us into a future that is cleaner and will sustain jobs for decades to come. The Inflation Reduction Act will help us reduce carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030. It also includes key tax credits and energy savings to boost your pocketbook and bring cost reductions and tax credits to your household. There are many ways to take advantage of these benefits, but it may be tough to know where to start. That's why the White House has released a guidebook for clean energy and climate programs. Through this resource, you can see how you might be able to benefit today, and you can sign up to receive updates as new resources and programs become available. From making home weatherization and efficiency upgrades, to installing new electric appliances, to purchasing an electric vehicle or rooftop solar system, the Inflation Reduction Act can help you save money while advancing the most aggressive climate action in U.S. history. Be sure to check out this resource to learn more, and I hope you'll let me know if you have any questions about how I'm working to develop a clean climate economy where everyone benefits - now and for generations to come. For updates throughout the week, don't forget to follow me on Facebook, Instagram , and Twitter.

As we close out 2022, I want to take a moment to reflect and get your thoughts on some of what we have accomplished for the 5th District in the past term. Please let us know your thoughts below on your top policy priorities. Click here to take Survey This summer, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law. This bill was the largest climate bill ever that will reduce carbon emissions by forty percent by 2030 . The package also lowers the price of prescription drugs and makes healthcare more affordable for families and seniors- dramatically lowering out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare recipients and capping their monthly insulin costs at $35 . It will drive over an estimated $6.6 billion of investment into Minnesota over the next decade. Another monumental accomplishment for our district was the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a major public safety package that will invest in desperately needed mental health support, violence prevention and intervention, and services for victims of gun violence. As the Whip of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, I was able to negotiate major improvements to this bill to ensure funding was targeted to small police departments, and to increase funding for training, accountability, and data collection. The House also passed the most significant gun safety legislation in over 30 years. Both bills will help combat the gun violence epidemic and make our communities safer. In the face of the Supreme Court overturning reproductive freedom, the House passed legislation to codify Roe v. Wade into law. Controlling decisions about your own body is a basic human right. I won't stop fighting to protect reproductive rights. President Biden also signed into law $17 million in federal funding I fought for through the House Appropriations' community project funding process for the 5th district. This funding directly invests in communities that were hit the hardest by both the pandemic and social unrest by addressing joblessness, housing and food insecurity, access to healthcare, and climate resiliency. I will continue to fight to make sure all Minnesotans across our district have the resources they need to thrive. Our work for a more equitable and just world continues. Fighting for the 5th Listening and Fighting for You My top priority is making sure members of our community are taken care of.

407," A message from Congresswoman Ann Wagner About Contact Services Media Center Issues Dear , Last week, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on the appalling FTX collapse. Sam Bankman-Fried was supposed to come before our committee to answer for his actions and explain what exactly went wrong, but he was arrested before I could question him live in front of the committee. This is an unprecedented fraud, and the American people deserve answers. Watch my questioning of the FTX bankruptcy CEO here . I went live on Fox with Bret Baier to give an update on the arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried and the Financial Services fact-finding hearing. As Vice Ranking Member of the Financial Services Committee, I will keep working to ensure retail investors have their savings protected from frauds like this. You can watch our full interview here . Retail investors deserve consistency and transparency. To ensure that goal, I introduced the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act, legislation that will help those saving for retirement, a down payment on a house, or for their children's future by making sure the SEC doesn't arbitrarily implement unnecessary and complex rules. Read more about this important legislation here . I went live with Diane Jones on KLPW to give a congressional update detail what the people can expect in January when Republicans have the majority. Listen here . As an Army mom, I have tremendous respect for anyone who answers the call of duty to protect and defend our nation. That's why I was so proud to pass legislation to honor one of the most influential military leaders in American history, Ulysses S. Grant. Missourians embody the values of President Grant. We are hardworking but humble, tough but generous, and feel a deep connection to our family, our neighbors, and our country. I look forward to this bill being signed into law so we can finally promote Grant to General of the Armies of the United States. We wish a very Happy Hanukkah to all our friends and neighbors celebrating.

408," News From Congressman Ben Cline Sixth District Perspectives with Congressman Ben Cline This week, lame duck, Democrat-controlled Washington once again failed to act to secure the border, strengthen the economy, tame inflation, or make our cities and communities safer. Instead of tackling these problems, Democrats moved the country one step closer to another $1.7 trillion in spending after passing a bill to fund the government for a week. Families don't run their household like this, and neither should the Federal government. Additionally, while inflation did fall a bit, it still was at a near 40-year high, and the warning signs of a recession are ever present. Closer to home, I was glad to recognize 75 years of service for the Fincastle Volunteer Fire Department and pay tribute to a great public servant, my friend, Ronnie Campbell, on the House floor. Lastly, I continued my town hall pledge with stops in Augusta, Roanoke, and Page Counties. The Continuing Resolution to Continue to Shortchange the American People I have consistently fought business as usual in Washington, and nowhere more so than the continued lack of ability for Congress to pass a budget to fund the government for the following year. Despite a requirement to do so, the Democrats and Speaker Pelosi worked overtime to pass a one-week Continuing Resolution to fund the government until December 23rd. This is the Democrats' last-ditch effort to lock in their agenda through trillions of dollars in a lame-duck spending before Christmas. I opposed this move and will work with the new Republican House Majority come January to fund government responsibly, not to green-light even more debt behind closed doors. Western Virginians are fed up with business as usual in Washington, and the Pelosi-Schumer spending spree that has crushed families' budgets. I took to the House floor to stand up for western Virginians who demanded change in Washington to rail against this deal to hamstring the American people. Click here to watch my speech. Bidenflation: The Grinch That Stole Christmas While there was a bit of easing in inflation, reports showed that prices rose a very Grinch-like 7.1% in November. The still near 40-year-high inflation rate is shrinking peoples' paychecks through ever increasing prices: eggs are up 49%, electricity up 13.7%, airline fares up 36%, bread up 15.7%, and butter up 27%. The economy has not recovered from years of Democrat-controlled Washington's reckless spending that has crippled the paychecks and savings of the American people. Republicans will work to restore fiscal responsibility come January, cut the massive spending spree, enact pro-growth policies, strengthen the supply chain, and unleash American energy dominance to get our country back on the path to economic prosperity. Tweet Remembering a Public Servant With sorrow, last week I honored the life and memory of the late Virginia Delegate, Ronnie Campbell, who passed away following a hard-fought battle with cancer. Ronnie cared deeply for his community and the Commonwealth, and devoted his life to serving others. He served in the House of Delegates as my successor and proudly represented the 24th district of Virginia. He made a career in law enforcement as a State Trooper with the Virginia State Police, working in Northern Virginia and Rockbridge County. He also spent time as a contractor, giving him insight into the impact that government regulations have on small businesses. Ronnie was driven to serve both his Rockbridge community and his home county of Augusta. He represented constituents as a member of the Rockbridge County School Board and as a member of the Rockbridge County Board of Supervisors. Ronnie spent countless hours dedicated to public service and will always be remembered as a stalwart conservative voice, a strong leader, and a gentle giant. Above all, he was a loyal friend and neighbor to all. Our hearts and prayers are with Ronnie's wife, Ellen, and his five children during this difficult time. May Ronnie's memory be eternal.

Lastly, thank you to everyone that came and joined the conversation at Rudy's Diner in Shenandoah last Friday evening. It was good meeting you and learning more about the issues that mean most to you.

For workers and families, health insurance can greatly reduce-or even eliminate-out-of-pocket medical care costs. Having more people insured also creates more productive communities and greater economic mobility. I voted for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the American Rescue Plan, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which have expanded access to affordable health insurance and lowered our out-of-pocket health costs. We capped the price of insulin, lowered prescription drug prices, and allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. As your voice in DC, I will continue to help expand health insurance coverage for the remaining 26% of TX-28 residents that remain uninsured.

410," Carper's Connection December 19, 2022 Dear Friend, There are 80,000 veterans like me living in Delaware. One of the greatest things we can do to honor their service is to make sure our veterans and their families have the benefits and support that they have earned through their service when they return home. Last week, I had the honor of hosting our annual Delaware Veterans Summit to highlight the PACT Act. Delaware's own President Joe Biden, Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Denis McDonough, our Congressional Delegation, Governor Carney, and many of our fellow veterans joined me at the Joseph R. ""Beau"" Biden National Guard/Reserve Conference Center in New Castle. We gathered to help spread the word about the expanded VA benefits now available thanks to the PACT Act, which I proudly supported this past summer, and President Biden signed into law. The PACT Act expands access to VA health care for upwards of 3.5 million Post-9/11 veterans, many of whom were exposed to toxic burn pits in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other conflict zones around the world. This truly historic law does right by an entire generation of veterans who have defended our country over the past two decades. It brings millions of new veterans into the VA health care system. I was so pleased to have been a part of the effort to secure this much-needed aid, and to be able to inform my fellow veterans now that the law is enacted. As a 23-year veteran of the Navy and Naval Reserves, and the last serving Vietnam veteran in the U.S. Senate, this issue is personal for me. But this new law and these new benefits will only be a success if we can make sure veterans here in Delaware and across the nation know that they and their families may be eligible to sign-up for health care benefits they have earned through their service. If you're a veteran or know someone who might have served overseas, tell them to go online to , visit your local VA hospital, or talk to a local Veteran Service Organization representative and sign-up for these new benefits thanks to the PACT Act. This bill will save lives-and we need to make sure we get the word out with your help.

411," December 12-16 Dear Friends, It is my greatest honor to represent you in Congress. As always, my mission is to advocate for Upstate New York and the North Country's priorities at the highest levels of government. Here is a look at my past week working for you in Congress. My Work This Week for Upstate New York and the North Country Promising Subpoenas to Provide Answers for Schoharie Limo Crash I'm calling on the FBI to provide information regarding my request for an anticipated timeline of their internal investigation into the Bureau's actions surrounding the 2018 Schoharie limousine crash, so the families impacted and the entire Schoharie community can have answers. The FBI is completely failing their responsibility to inform Congress, and they can no longer brush off my requests on behalf of New York families. These families and the entire Schoharie community were devastated by the deadly limo tragedy that could have been avoided if not for FBI negligence. Make no mistake, House Republicans will have control of the gavels next Congress, and the FBI can expect rigorous oversight next year for their involvement in the most deadly transportation disaster in decades to get answers for these families. The subpoenas are coming in the Republican majority. Learn more about my advocacy here. Watch news coverage here. Supporting Federal Correctional Officers New York's 21st District is home to many brave correctional officers, and I am proud to advance the bipartisan Prison Camera Reform Act, which I cosponsored, to give our federal correctional officers one more tool to increase their safety on the job . Outdated and inadequate equipment, including security cameras, radios, and public address devices, jeopardize the safety of the nation's correctional officers and make it more difficult for investigators to substantiate incidents of misconduct. This bipartisan legislation will address critical deficiencies, so officers, who put their lives on the line daily, have the support they need. Now, that it has passed the House and Senate, it is on its way to being signed into law. Learn more here. Holding the Line Against More Reckless Democrat Spending One-party Democrat rule in Washington has increased the price of almost everything for every hardworking family and created the most expensive Christmas in history. This week, at the final hour, Lame Duck Democrats are failing to responsibly keep the government running in pursuit of their radical agenda. From the beginning, Democrats have cut House Republicans out of negotiations to attempt one more Far Left radical spending package before they lose power. I will reject the Far Left's wish list that pushes trillions of taxpayer dollars to fund their radical agenda. Make no mistake, on day one in the Republican majority, am committed to reining in Democrats' reckless spending and failed policies. Read my full statement here. Watch my full remarks of this week's press conference here. Pushing for Accountability for COVID Origins This week, my colleagues on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which I serve on, released a bombshell report revealing more questions about COVID-19's ties to China's bioweapons research, and we learned that key information was withheld from authorized public officials. As we learn more evidence, the facts are clear, China lied, released this virus on the world, and people died. The American people deserve to know the truth about the origins of COVID-19, and I will continue to push for answers. Read the full report here. My Statement on Puerto Rico Statehood I am supportive of statehood for Puerto Rico, if that is what the people of Puerto Rico decide to pursue, and I have consistently supported legislation throughout my time in Congress that would achieve the goals of self-determined statehood, a principle which has been a long-held position of the Republican Party. However, I do not support this week's proposal that would allow independence. The United States should bring the over three million American citizens in Puerto Rico closer, rather than pushing them further away. This last minute bill was brought to the floor by Nancy Pelosi without a committee hearing on the text. A proposal as complicated and impactful as statehood requires a thorough review and debate.

412," Risch, Colleagues' Human Trafficking Prevention Bill Headed to President's Desk Contact: Amy Hasenberg FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE December 19, 2022 Risch, Colleagues' Human Trafficking Prevention Bill Headed to President's Desk Bipartisan legislation passes the Senate, will now be signed into law WASHINGTON - Last week, the U.S. Senate passed the bipartisan Human Trafficking Prevention Act that Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) introduced to help prevent human trafficking by requiring the posting of the National Human Trafficking Hotline in the restrooms of all U.S. planes, busses, and trains, as well as airports, bus stations, and rail stations. The companion bill passed the House on a bipartisan basis in July. The legislation now goes to the President's desk to be signed into law. ""I applaud Congress for passing the Human Trafficking Prevention Act and taking this step in preventing this abhorrent crime,"" said Senator Risch. ""That said, there is still more to be done and I will continue to support anti-trafficking efforts, provide victims with the necessary resources, and ensure traffickers are punished to the fullest extent."" ""The Human Trafficking Hotline is a lifeline that can help save victims - and by displaying it on every bus, train, and plane, we can get more people the help that they desperately need,"" said Senator Hassan. ""Our commonsense bill is one critical way to prevent human trafficking, and I look forward to our legislation being signed into law."" ""Human trafficking continues to cause suffering for millions of people, especially young women and girls. We must do everything we can to help the victims. This is a commonsense bill to expose this evil,"" said Senator Rubio. ""Human trafficking is a heinous crime that threatens the well-being of women, men, and children across this country and around the world,"" said Senator Rosen. ""The national human trafficking hotline has been a highly effective tool in helping victims, and I'm glad to see that our bipartisan bill will now become law."" The National Human Trafficking Hotline is a toll-free service connecting victims and survivors of trafficking to critical support and resources. The Hotline provides both a toll-free phone line and SMS text lines which are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Help is available in English, Spanish or in more than 200 additional languages through an on-call interpreter.

414," Dear  , Last week, I voted to secure several major Montana priorities in the 2023 defense bill. This year's bipartisan defense package ends the overreaching vaccine mandate for Montana servicemembers, includes a well-deserved pay raise for our military, protects women from the draft, and strengthens our nuclear triad to ensure America's military remains the best in the world. Montana wins in the bipartisan defense package: Ending the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for servicemembers Protecting women from the military draft Giving military servicemembers a 4.6% pay raise Adjusting the basic allowance for housing (BAH) in high-cost areas to combat the housing shortage for servicemembers Strengthening our national security through establishing a directorate within the Air Force Global Strike Command called the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Task Force to manage the transition and activation of the new LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM weapon system at Malmstrom Bolstering watercraft inspections to control invasive species such as zebra mussels Expediting hydropower development on Army Corps of Engineers dams As your voice in the United States Senate, I will continue fighting for policies to support Montana servicemembers and strengthen our military.

415," Dear Friend, You can find my latest update below! Dr. Rand Paul Continues to Speak Out Against Pelosi-Schumer End of Year Spending Bill The American people sent an unmistakable message in the November midterm elections, making clear that they want a Republican-led House to serve as check on the unfettered spending of the current Democrat-controlled Congress. Last Wednesday, I once again joined a group of five likeminded Senators in expressing opposition to passing the looming end of year Pelosi-Schumer omnibus spending bill in the lame duck Congress. The Democrats and Big Government Republicans will be offering you a Christmas tree. The Christmas tree in Washington is a bill that has something on it for everyone. You won't know what it is until you get it. You won't be able to read it until it's done. But it will happen because the only thing that invariably happens in Washington is they will get together to spend money. Democrats and Big Government Republicans every year pass a spending bill that has no budget. It's typically a spending bill in which everything is glommed together in one. It'll be a spending bill that's thousands of pages long, no one will ever read it, and it will be given with only hours before we're supposed to pass it. And then there will be a reversal of blame. The blame won't attach to the people who, frankly, I wouldn't put in charge of running a minute mart because of their lack of business sense. It won't attach to people who cobbled together a multi-thousand-page bill in the dead of night, didn't show it to anyone, and put it forward. They will say if you vote 'no,' you are to blame for shutting down the government. I, however, am not for shutting down the government, but am for spending less money and accumulating less debt. We're the largest financial entity in the United States, and yet we don't have a budget or plan for how we're going to do the spending for the next year until hours before we vote on it. Everyday businesses all across the country don't cobble together a budget and say to their board of directors, ""oh, here it is, you can read it after you approve it."" This is the nightmare before Christmas. A foolish way to run government and I won't participate in it. For the Senate to ram through another spending bill in a matter of days-which would fund the entirety of the Pelosi-Schumer spending agenda through most of next year-would utterly disempower the new Republican House from enacting our shared priorities. We need to stop Washington's pattern of ramming through unaccounted-for spending packages. We should respect the will of the American people expressed through the November election and allow the newly elected 118th Congress to determine funding and priorities for the federal government in the upcoming year. You can read more about my efforts HERE , and watch the press conference I hosted with Senators Rick Scott (R-FL), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Ron Johnson (R-WI) last Wednesday HERE . Dr. Rand Paul Pens Op-Ed on the Electoral College and Limited Government Recently, I penned an op-ed published in the Louisville Courier Journal where I discussed the Electoral College and limited government. As I wrote in the piece, the Electoral College is under bitter attack by Democrats and has been for decades. After the 2000 presidential election, Hillary Clinton told reporters, ""it's time to do away with the Electoral College and move to the popular election of our president."" Twenty years later, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren advocated abolishing the Electoral College while running for president. The Electoral College is a friend to those who believe in limited government and our federalist system. We must save it. The Electoral College is emblematic of the benefits of federalism. The United States is a continental nation that includes multiple cultures, values and points of view. An individual cannot win the presidency by merely pandering to coastal population centers. The Electoral College guarantees that a president can only be elected (and re-elected) by appealing to a broad base of Americans. In short, the Electoral College is the Founders' answer to a potential tyranny of the majority. The Electoral College is worth saving but, without reform, I fear the calls for abolishing the Electoral College might succeed. Congress has the opportunity to preserve and strengthen the states' role in conducting presidential elections. The Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act is a bipartisan bill designed to ensure that Congress obeys state law. Unless the laws or constitution of a state identify another official to do so, the reformed Electoral Count Act designates the governor to certify the state's presidential electors to prevent different officials from sending competing slates of electors to Congress. Additionally, the bill makes clear that the Vice President is to play a solely ministerial role in the counting of electoral votes. The legislation also increases the threshold that would trigger a congressional debate on objections to a state's election results to one-fifth of each the House and Senate, meaning that the transfer of power would not provide an occasion for frivolous challenges. In other words, this legislation preserves the Founders' intent that the laws and election results of the several states are respected.

Dr. Rand Paul Honors Just For You Boutique of Frankfort as Senate Small Business of the Week As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit. Recently, I had the privilege of recognizing Just For You Boutique of Frankfort, Kentucky, as the Senate Small Business of the Week. Across the country you will not find two small businesses with the same origin story. In most cases, the tale behind how one gets started is just as unique as the business itself. Such is the story of Nicole Boyd's business, Just For You Boutique. Nicole, a native of the Bluegrass state, was driving through its capital when she found herself stopped at a red light. As she gazed out the window towards an empty store front, she couldn't help but notice a big ""Available for Sale or Rent"" sign in the window. It was in that moment that Nicole decided that she would open her own clothing store, right there in that location. Sometimes all it takes is a self-starting individual to make their dream a reality, as is the case with Nicole. Not long after that fateful stop in Frankfort traffic, Just For You Boutique opened up on March 8th, 2016. As an active member of the community, Nicole's favorite aspect of owning her own business is that it enables her to really engage with the people of Frankfort, as she is constantly seeing friends and neighbors walk through her doors. Moreover, Nicole understands that successful businesses put their community first. She often collaborates with other small businesses around Frankfort to offer products and experiences that are unique to Kentucky and to Frankfort specifically. Nicole offers a wide variety of goods in her store, from fashion-forward apparel and jewelry to everyday home goods that could liven up any living space. Nicole pays special mind to feature homegrown Kentucky products, between coffee grinds made by local brewers and handcrafted artisanal soaps from local companies, Nicole makes Kentucky vendors her merchandise mainstay. Given the wide variety of goods she keeps in store, it would only make sense that Nicole would choose to name her boutique Just For You as it is a place where anyone, whether shopping for a gift or for themselves, can find something that is uniquely for them. Part of what makes Just For You Boutique so special is that Nicole understands that strength often comes in numbers. She jumps at every opportunity to amplify her store by collaborating with other small businesses around the state capital, thereby growing the customer base for businesses across Main Street. Not only does Nicole do her best to support other small businesses around Frankfort, she runs her store with a charitable heart. When a young lady around Frankfort was diagnosed with breast cancer, Nicole jumped into action. Suzanna, who had spent a lot of time inside Just For You Boutique, designed shirts emblazoned with a pink cancer ribbon with the hashtag #SuzannaStrong. In a show of support for Suzanna, Nicole printed shirt with her design and began selling them in her store, with all proceeds from the sales going towards the cost of Suzanna's medical treatment. It is acts of kindness such as these that sets Just For You Boutique apart from other businesses, as Nicole keeps her finger on the pulse of developments around the community and always keeps an ear out for those in need. I want to commend Nicole on making her dream of owning her own a store a reality, and thank her for all that she does to support small businesses. Congratulations to Nicole Boyd along with the entire team at Just For Your Boutique. I look forward to seeing your continued growth and success in Kentucky.

416," CONTACT ISSUES MEDIA SERVICES ABOUT Hi Friends, As we wrap up the 117th Congress, I want to share with you some of the work I've done this Congress to ensure the growth and prosperity of our community. We've done a lot of great work, and I'm excited to continue that momentum into the 118th Congress. Voted to Pass the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act On Thursday, December 8th, I voted to pass the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 7776, the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act . Every year, Congress must pass this legislation to fund our military and ensure our troops have the resources necessary to address threats against our nation, invest in modern technology, and support our defense initiatives. This bill included a 4.6 percent pay increase - the largest since 2007 - for our service members and an increase to the maximum allowable income to receive the Basic Needs Allowance to 150 percent of the federal poverty line. I am also happy to announce that my amendment, which requires the Secretary of Defense to provide an annual report to Congress on the number of non-citizen members of the Armed Forces, their immigration status, and how many naturalized that year, was included. This provision is the first step to fast track our service members towards a path to citizenship. We must keep our promise to take care of the brave men and women who've put their lives on the line to defend our country. It is past time we bring our unjustly deported Veterans home. Watch my video in the old House chamber after we passed the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act here . Voted to Pass the Veteran Service Recognition Act On Tuesday, December 6th, I voted to pass H.R. 7946, the Veteran Service Recognition Act , which provides our non-citizen service members a pathway to citizenship and brings wrongfully deported Veterans home. Throughout my time in Congress, I've called for Congressional action to right this wrong. I introduced H.R. 4393, the Repatriate Our Patriots Act , a similar piece of legislation that provides a solution to bring our deported Veterans home. It is a stain on our nation that we have treated our service members this way. I am proud we have begun to address this issue. We must reunite our Veterans with their loved ones here at home and prevent this atrocity from ever happening again. Watch my floor speech in support of the Veteran Service Recognition Act here . Voted to Pass the Respect for Marriage Ac t On Thursday, December 8th, I voted for H.R. 8404, the Respect for Marriage Act, which federally recognizes same-sex and interracial marriages. It is long past time our nation codifies these long-held beliefs into law. I am proud to play a part in a far-reaching law that protects equality in marriage for all in the eyes of the Federal government. Spoke to MSNBC's ""Meet The Press"" About Our Southern Border On Wednesday, December 14th, I joined Chuck Todd on ""Meet the Press"" to discuss the end of Title 42 and what that means for our community. It's simple, we have an immigration problem, and it should not be incumbent on our border communities to stretch budgets thin to meet the needs of migrants arriving at our Southern border. I introduced legislation this year, H.R. 8823, the Safe Zones Ac t, to change the asylum process by creating safe zones at the Mexico-Guatemala border to provide a safe place for migrants to apply for asylum. This bill would end the dangerous and deadly trek to our southern border and cut criminal profits out of the equation. We have solutions to this issue, and Congress and the White House must act immediately to provide a humane path to asylum seekers and much needed relief to our border communities. Watch the interview here . Announced Service Academy Nominees On Wednesday, December 14th, I announced my nomination of young leaders in the 15th Congressional District of Texas to Military Services Academies. These eight South Texans will go on to hone their education and leadership skills to better serve our country. Service Academy attendees commit to serving in our nation's military for a minimum of five years upon graduation. These brave young men and women are taking control of their future, and I am so proud to know that we have dedicated South Texans who are answering the call to serve. Congratulations to our nominees: Announced the 2022 Congressional App Challenge Winners On Thursday, December 8th, I announced the winners of the 2022 Congressional App Challenge for the 15th Congressional District. This challenge encourages our middle and high school students in South Texas to engage and explore the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). This year we had a record-breaking number of submissions, and I am heartened to know that we have so many engaged and bright students who are ready to meet the challenges of tomorrow.

417," Friend, We are in the business of customer service. Our team is dedicated to helping Iowans solve problems they have with the federal government. This year, we've closed over 2,500 constituent cases by helping people get back money they are owed by the IRS, collecting missing Social Security and veterans' benefits, and expediting passport cases to help people reunite with their families. I'm proud of the problems we've been able to solve for Iowans, so if you've run into a dead end or have any questions regarding federal agencies, please make sure you reach out to our team. For example, we've helped veterans schedule appointments at the local VA and recover lost VA benefits. When a constituent had her identity stolen, the IRS sent her a massive bill and she was unable to receive her Social Security payments. After we advocated on her behalf, the IRS withdrew their bill and she received the Social Security benefits she was owed. These are just a few ways our team has helped Iowans who felt like they had nowhere else to turn and were failed by the federal bureaucracy. If you're getting a dial-tone when trying to reach someone, don't know who to talk to about problem, or have any issue with a federal agency, we are here to answer your questions. There is no ask too small or challenge too big - we are here to serve, and we will leave no stone unturned to help. Please visit or reach out to any of my district offices in Cedar Rapids, Dubuque, and Waterloo with any questions or to learn more about how we can serve you and your families. Dubuque Office 1050 Main St. Dubuque, IA 52001 Phone: (563) 557-7789 Waterloo Office 521A Lafayette Street Waterloo, IA 50703 Phone: (319) 266-6925 Cedar Rapids Office 118 3rd Ave SE Suite 206 Cedar Rapids, IA 52401 Phone: (319) 364-2288 Best, Protecting U.S. Farmland from Communist China Communist China has been strategically and aggressively buying up U.S. farmland near military bases, threatening our food supply and our national security. I am proud to support the Agricultural Foreign Investment Transparency Act, legislation to strengthen our oversight of their malicious activity and help block China from buying another acre of U.S. farmland. We must take the threat posed by Communist China head on -- there is no time to waste. I'll continue working to hold Communist China accountable and to protect our national security. Bipartisan VA Same Day Scheduling Act We often hear from veterans who struggle to make appointments at the local VA. I'm cosponsoring the VA Same Day Scheduling Act, bipartisan legislation that will make it easier for veterans to schedule appointments at the VA and receive care in a timely manner. I will continue working across the aisle to ensure our veterans can receive the care they have earned. Poll: Children's Cold Medicine Shortage I've heard from parents who are worried about the current shortage of children's medications - from cold medicine to amoxicillin. Understandably, parents are increasingly concerned by these shortages with RSV and flu cases on the rise. This is on top of the ongoing baby formula shortage. Parents should have peace of mind that if they're going to the store for basic medications or baby formula for their kids, they're going to find it. I'm monitoring this situation closely, and your perspective and input will be invaluable to me as I look at potential solutions. Please take my poll below! Have you noticed low stock of children's medications or baby formula at your local store? Yes No Thank You, Servicemembers! Our brave troops are giving up the holidays with their families so that we can celebrate safely with ours. I recently joined the American Red Cross to send messages of support and encouragement to our service members overseas! Serving Iowans Alex and Delia just completed their internships with our team - they both did a phenomenal job serving Iowans. I love seeing young women who are so passionate about serving others and learning about how they can make a difference by working on meaningful policy!

Unfortunately, Americans are still being forced to pay high prices on nearly everything due to inflation. The November Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed an inflation rate of 7.1% - 1.7% higher than the CPI in July 2021 when President Biden told Americans that inflation was just "" temporary "". Now, American households are having to budget over $700 a month more than usual to keep up with the skyrocketing cost of goods and services. Inflation stretches budgets, creates financial hardship, and disrupts our nation's economy as a whole. Despite these harmful consequences, Washington Democrats continue to push through excessive and wasteful spending packages that only fuel inflation and make it more difficult for folks to provide for themselves and their families. Hardworking Americans are paying the price of high inflation: Food at elementary and secondary schools are UP 254.1% . Fuel oil is UP 65.7% . Flour is UP 24.9% . Cereals and bakery products are UP 16.4% . Electricity is UP 13.7% . I have and will continue to advocate for policies in Washington that target the true causes of inflation, empower workers and small businesses, and put our economy back on a strong and stable path. This means I will work with my colleagues to curb wasteful government spending, create good-paying jobs, return our supply chain from China, and make sure hardworking Americans have an economy that sets them up for success. It's time for Washington to make a serious change to their spending habits, and I stand ready and able to do so so that you can once again feel confident in supporting yourself and your loved ones.

419," Hi there, It's an honor to be your voice in Congress. Here's a look at my latest work for you in Washington and around Utah's Fourth District. My team is always on call, and we want to hear from you! For more information on our efforts in the House, services my office can provide, or to share your thoughts with me, visit or give us a call at 801-999-9801 . Around the Fourth District Parliamentary Intelligence Security Forum Human Trafficking Task Force At last week's PSIF Parliamentary Task Force on Human Trafficking meeting, I shared the story of my great-great-grandfather, Silas Burgess, who came to America in the belly of a slave ship. Today, an estimated 50 million people worldwide are trapped in modern slavery. Human trafficking is a deplorable crime of exploitation that steals freedom for personal profit. We must work together to eradicate this multi-billion-dollar industry and ensure justice for survivors. Americans for Prosperity Pioneers for Prosperity Award What an honor to receive the Americans for Prosperity Pioneers for Prosperity Award! I'll keep working hard in Congress and at home in Utah to achieve commonsense solutions that address our nation's greatest challenges. USANA Tour and Kids Eat Project I teamed up with the USANA Kids Eat Foundation to help pack backpacks full of food for weekend and holiday meals. Utahns go above and beyond to help our neighbors in need, and I'm thankful for the extraordinary work this organization does to feed thousands of at-risk students. Campus Free Speech Roundtable Freedom of speech is a fundamental Constitutional right. Proud to join my colleagues at last week's Campus Free Speech Roundtable to discuss protecting open dialogue on America's college campuses. Watch the full roundtable here . Audio Enhancement My team and I enjoyed visiting Audio Enhancement in West Jordan last week to learn more about their efforts to improve speaker systems and classroom safety technology in schools across Utah. Thank you for all you do to empower students and maximize learning opportunities. Legislative Update Child Care Development Block Grant The cost of child care is skyrocketing, and the sticker shock is a roadblock for parents across America as they work to earn a living, get an education, and make ends meet. For the past 30 years, the bipartisan Child Care and Development Block Grant has delivered flexible, affordable, and trusted child care options at low or no cost to millions of hardworking families. The work to improve educational opportunities and outcomes begins with ensuring that every parent has the ability to choose the child care option that meets the unique needs of their family, and I am proud to lead the program's reauthorization. Speak Out Act Last week, President Biden signed the Speak Out Act into law. The Speak Out Act empowers survivors to tell their stories without the threat of nondisclosure agreements that silence victims, empower predators, and shield harassment and misconduct. We need to ensure every American has a safe and respectful workplace where they can thrive, and I'm proud to see this important bill become law. Create Accountability and Liability Against Lifeline Attacks (CALL) Act of 2022 The 988 lifeline saved an estimated 150,000 lives during its debut month, and any attempts to derail the unprecedented success of this service will not stand. I am proud to support the CALL Act , bipartisan legislation to take swift action against criminals who obstruct both the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline and the Veterans Crisis Line, and ensure mental health resources are accessible to every American. Saline Lake Ecosystems in the Great Basin States Program Act I was proud to join the Utah delegation last week to vote in favor of S. 1466, the Saline Lake Ecosystems in the Great Basin States Program Act, to build on local measures that address declining water levels and enhance conservation efforts to save the Great Salt Lake and preserve our nation's most treasured natural resources. The Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) There is no substitute for a strong national defense budget that protects the American people and our national interests. Unfortunately, the Biden administration's proposal to cut defense spending, weak foreign policy, and incompetent leadership has undermined our national security. This year's National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) provides robust investments in military infrastructure, raises pay for our troops, and reverses many of the administration's reckless policies. I was proud to support the NDAA in the House and will always stand strong for America's men and women in uniform. Protecting Utah's Independent Contractors I co-signed a letter to the Department of Labor regarding its proposed rule for determining independent contractor classification that would have immediate and long-term disruptive effects on millions of workers and thousands of businesses at a time when the economy is facing high inflation rates. The proposed rule will jeopardize millions of individuals' independent contractor status under the FLSA. Instead, DOL should maintain the 2021 rule, which was designed for the modern economy and brought clarity to workers and businesses. Read the full letter here . Advocating for Utah's Tart Cherry Industry From Payson to Santaquin and all along the Utah County foothills, Utah leads the nation in tart cherry production. Last week, I co-signed a bicameral and bipartisan letter to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Robert Califf urging the FDA to redefine the proposed definition of ""healthy,"" which would exclude most cranberry and tart cherry products. Utah's farmers and agricultural producers work day in and day out to support our communities, and I will always stand strong for this critical industry. Read the full letter here . Pushing Back on the National Labor Relations Board's Inconsistent Rule for Franchises I joined 67 colleagues in writing a letter to National Labor Relations Board Chairman Lauren M. McFerran to oppose the Board's joint employer proposed rule that is inconsistent with the common law, circumvents Congressional authority, and will negatively impact the nation's economy and their constituents. Read the full letter here . Honoring the 30th Anniversary of the Central Utah Project Completion Act Last week, I spoke on the House Floor to mark the 30th Anniversary of the Central Utah Project Completion Act (CUPCA), the largest water resources development program in Utah and a game-changer for delivering clean and reliable water across the region.

420," News from Congresswoman Wilson [image: Image] *Home* *About Me* *News* *Contact* Dear Friend, Our nation's teachers have been underpaid, overworked, and deprived of resources for too long. It is no surprise that our country is facing a severe teacher shortage. Teachers are the backbone of our education system and economy. With deep and widespread teacher shortages across the nation, we need to get serious about prioritizing competitive salaries for educators. Nearly one in five teachers have to work two to three jobs to make ends meet, which is unacceptable! No issue is more important than providing our children with fully supported and well-resourced teachers. It's time for Congress to address this issue head-on; inaction is detrimental to teachers and students. Last week, I proudly filed the *American Teacher Act *to raise the minimum teacher salary to $60,000. My bill is a critical first step in the fight to provide livable, competitive wages for America's teachers, and it would also incentivize states to adjust salaries for inflation. [image: Image] ------------------------------ *The American Teacher Act * Today, teacher shortages are among the most pressing challenges to education access, and school districts are forced to adjust school offerings to account for teacher shortages drastically. Every day, stories surface of schools shortening their weeks, canceling courses, increasing student-teacher ratios, and resorting to underqualified teachers to teach core courses. Such adjustments disrupt learning, take a sustained toll on teacher morale, and harm student achievement. [image: Image] Underinvesting in teachers perpetuates the shortage, devaluing the profession and demoralizing teachers. It's unfathomable that more than 9,000 school districts are still offering a starting salary of $40,000. Such compensation, amid growing inflation, makes it nearly impossible to recruit, train, and retain qualified teachers. The low wages are even lower among teachers of color. [image: Image] Teacher shortages have become a national problem and will require a national solution. The American Teacher Act will garner bipartisan support. We can all agree that our children deserve teachers empowered with good salaries, resources, and support. It's time for Congress to deliver for teachers like they've delivered for our children and our nation, especially during this pandemic. The American Teacher Act gives our nation's teachers the raise they have earned and deserve. [image: Image] Education fuels the future. The American Teacher Act elevates education as a national priority and addresses teacher shortages. Every teacher in America should be paid at least $60,000 annually, and I am committed to ensuring they get the raise they deserve. [image: Image] ------------------------------ *Updates From Congress* As the Chair of the Higher Education and Workforce Investment Subcommittee, I was honored to lead a great hearing on AmeriCrops. Michael Smith, AmeriCorps's CEO, highlighted their outstanding work and his efforts to address challenges facing this program as they work to build stronger communities through volunteer service. [image: Image] [image: Image] ------------------------------ Whether it's at community events, on the phone, or in the grocery store, I hear from our constituents daily about their challenges and priorities. This week, we are back in session and are working hard to pass legislation that deliver solutions for the American people. As we reach the end of the year, please continue sharing your perspective, reaching out, and advocating for important issues for you and your family! Civic engagement is the key to keeping our democracy healthy and coming together with our best ideas to move our country forward. Sincerely, Frederica S.

421," Weekly Wrap: December 12 - 16, 2022 ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ News from Representative Hayes Dear  , Welcome to The Weekly Wrap , a recap of the week in Congress and highlights of my work. Last week marked 10 years since the tragic loss of 26 lives at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. On Wednesday, Members and staff throughout the Capitol honored their memories with a moment of silence. Also, the House passed my legislation, the Help Find the Missing Act (Billy's Law). The bill is named after Billy Smolinski of Waterbury. On Tuesday, I joined the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and Governor Lamont to announce Connecticut will receive additional funding to expand access to high-speed internet throughout our state. Lastly, I am pleased to share New Britain is among a number of municipalities in CT-05 to receive funding through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program . These grants support the growing needs of law enforcement. For the full recap, please read below. Weekly Wrap: December 12 - 16, 2022 Honoring With Action Newtown is a small community with a big heart, a community that changed forever 10 years ago, bonded by a shared grief. On December 14, 2012, we lost 26 beautiful souls at Sandy Hook Elementary School . While this community continues to mourn the loss of their loved ones, they have also honored their memories through service. Every single family who lost a loved one at Sandy Hook has found a way to be of service with everything from violence prevention programs like Sandy Hook Promise, to Embrace Hope which is an equine therapy program. There is also the Anna Grace Project and Ben's Lighthouse, Charlotte's Litter Dog Therapy Program, the Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary, Emily's Art Connection, and the Vicky Soto Project, to promote a love of teaching. On Wednesday, Members and staff throughout the Capitol gathered for a moment of silence to honor their memories. Additionally, the 10th Annual National Vigil for All Victims of Gun Violence was held in Washington D.C. I remain committed to ensuring our schools and communities are safe and will continue to support gun violence prevention measures to put an end to this epidemic. Help Find the Missing Act Each year, hundreds of thousands of Americans go missing. Many will never be seen by their loved ones again. At the same time, there are an estimated 40,000 sets of unidentified human remains across the country that are either held at coroners' offices or disposed of after going unclaimed. Sadly, because of gaps in our databases, these missing persons and unidentified remains are rarely matched. On Wednesday, the House voted 422-4 to pass my Help Find the Missing Act (Billy's Law). This legislation will help solve missing persons cases and bring closure to their loved ones by fixing these gaps. Specifically, the legislation: Directs the Department of Justice (DOJ) to continue to operate the National Missing Persons and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), providing a missing persons/unidentified remains database to which the public can contribute and access; Connects NamUs with the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) in order to create more comprehensive missing persons and unidentified remains databases and streamlining the reporting process for local law enforcement; Expands current law by requiring missing children be reported to NamUs (they already must be reported to NCIC); and Requires DOJ to issue guidelines and best practices on handling missing persons and unidentified remains cases in order to empower law enforcement, medical examiners and coroners to help find the missing. I am pleased to be the lead sponsor of this legislation in the House, which is inspired by Janice and Bill Smolinski of Cheshire, Connecticut, after their 31-year-old son, Billy, went missing in Waterbury. For years, I drove past billboards with Billy's picture and read about him in local newspapers. Getting Billy's Law passed is a hometown win and will help families bring home the missing and offer closure to the families of those who will never return home. This bill was originally introduced and championed by Senator Chris Murphy over 13 years ago. Additional information on Billy's Law is available here . Expanding Access to High-Speed Internet Access to reliable high-speed internet is not a luxury. For many of my constituents, particularly in the Northwest Corner of Connecticut, it is a matter of health and safety. As evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, broadband internet is necessary for work, school, to stay connected, and receive health care. On Tuesday, I joined the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and Governor Ned Lamont to announce Connecticut will receive additional funding to expand access to high-speed internet. Funded by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program and the Digital Equity Program will help ensure communities across Connecticut have access to the tools necessary to participate in our growing digital economy. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act also provides Connecticut with a minimum allocation of $100 million to improve coverage across the state, ensuring an additional 27,000 Connecticut residents will have broadband access. I am pleased to have voted in support of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and to direct federal funding to Connecticut, which continues to be of incredible benefit to our state. Grant Funding for New Britain The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program allows units of local government, including tribes, to support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime based on their own state and local needs and conditions. I am happy to share the City of New Britain will receive over $200,000 of federal funding to better support the growing needs of law enforcement agencies, advance justice, and keep communities safe.

422,"Experts Gather for COVID-19 Vaccines Roundtable Roundtable speakers I held another roundtable to learn from the government's pandemic response. This one was called COVID-19 Vaccines: What they Are, How They Work, and Possible Causes of Injuries. My intent is to shed light on the current state of knowledge surrounding the vaccine and explore the path forward. I was joined by experts and medical professionals to discuss the scientific background of the coronavirus, functionality of the vaccine, failures in the pandemic response, early treatment drugs, adverse reactions, vaccine injuries and plans for future research and response. I think of the many problems during the pandemic, one of the biggest casualties was modesty in admitting how much we don't know. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I've been a strong proponent of holding the federal government accountable for their failed response to COVID-19 and a leading advocate for early treatment, healthcare freedom and individuals who have experienced adverse vaccine reactions. This three-hour discussion was my fifth roundtable on COVID-19. You can watch the entire discussion here or watch this 30-minute recap video. I encourage you to forward and share this information! Click on the tweet below to see one of the more shocking moments from the roundtable. Tweet from roundtable Goodbye Military COVID-19 Vaccine Mandate service member getting vaccine Over 8,000 service members have been terminated for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Last week, I supported passage of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that rescinds the Biden Administration's harmful and pointless COVID-19 vaccine policy. Even though the Senate blocked Sen. Ted Cruz's and my amendment that would have reinstated service members discharged for refusing a vaccine with back pay, I supported passage of the NDAA that rescinds Biden's military COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Our men and women of the U.S. military are the finest among us and deserve members of Congress fighting for their health autonomy and healthcare freedom. On Friday, I joined nine of my Republican colleagues in a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin urging him to freeze all COVID-19 vaccine-related discharges, and to establish a quick and thorough process so all members who were discharged because they refused the COVID-19 vaccine can be reinstated with back pay and full benefits. Watch my floor speech here. The Question No One Can Answer Press Conference on Federal Building Do you know how much money the federal government spent last year? I've been asking my colleagues and journalists in Washington, D.C. this question and virtually nobody knows. Why is that? We are the largest financial entity in the world, and we never talk about how much total money we spend. I joined Sens. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in a press conference to oppose the Pelosi-Schumer Omnibus spending bill and argue in favor of a short-term Continuing Resolution to allow ample time to analyze and debate additional government spending. In 2019, before the COVID-19 spending increase, federal spending totaled $4.4 trillion. As we approach the end of 2022, a 36% increase in spending to $6.0 trillion has been estimated. So the question haven't we gone back to normal spending now that the pandemic is over? Watch my press conference remarks here.

Chag Sameach to all who celebrate! It was another busy week in Washington! On Thursday, I had the privilege of presiding as Speaker Pro Tempore of the House of Representatives for debate on the House floor over the Puerto Rico Status Act (H.R. 8393) , which would grant the people of Puerto Rico the opportunity to determine the future of their island. If enacted, this bipartisan legislation would dedicate federal resources to fund and organize a binding plebiscite in which Puerto Ricans on the island could vote among three options: statehood, independence, or sovereignty in free association with the United States. The bill passed the House of Representatives. The House passed several other pieces of legislation on a bipartisan basis. Importantly, we passed a continuing resolution to extend government funding through December 23, 2022, while House and Senate members finalize an appropriations bill to fund the government through the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends next September. We expect to vote on that omnibus appropriations package this week. The House passed several other bills last week, including: The Flood Level Observation, Operations, and Decision Support ( FLOODS ) Act , S. 558, to improve the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) forecasting and communication of flood, tornado, and hurricane events; The Help Find the Missing Act , S. 5230, to close loopholes in missing persons systems in the U.S. by streamlining the missing persons reporting process and ensuring that law enforcement databases are more accessible and comprehensive; and The Iran Hostages Congressional Gold Medal Act , S. 2607, to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the 53 hostages of the Iran Hostage Crisis from 1979 to 1981, in recognition of their bravery. In addition to voting on legislation, I joined my colleagues in sending a few letters on issues important to our community: A letter to United States Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young supporting funding for the Texas Coastal Spine to be included in President Biden's Fiscal Year 2024 budget; and A letter to House and Senate Leadership urging them to prevent Medicare physician reimbursement cuts that are set to go into effect next year. I have heard from many of the physicians in our district on this issue, and am working to address it. Another important note of work from our House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Recently, the House passed the Data Mapping to Save Moms' Lives Act , S. 198, to require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to integrate data related to maternal mortality and morbidity into the agency's Mapping Broadband Health in America platform, in an effort to help address the maternal mortality crisis in our country. The United States has the highest rate of maternal mortality among developed nations, and I was glad to work with my colleagues on the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology to pass this important legislation. For pregnant women, access to fast, reliable broadband is a crucial tool for telehealth services, routine checkups, health monitoring, and updating prescriptions. This bill will help us better understand the telehealth and telecommunications barriers many women face so that we can adopt informed, robust connectivity policies to keep expectant mothers safe and healthy. Thank you to everyone who participated in Monday's virtual year-end town hall meeting. At this busy time of year, I was glad so many people took time to listen in to my summary of the year's work and my answers to many questions that came in. It has been a very productive year and Congress. I am looking forward to sending out this year's Annual Report soon. Watch your email for this summary of the work our TX-07 team has done this year! I was honored to join those assembled at the White House to witness President Biden sign the Respect for Marriage Act , the bipartisan bill that codifies same-sex and interracial marriages that the House and Senate passed this year. This legislation is so important to our community and country, and I was proud to be included in the celebration. I headed home from Washington just in time to spend Friday visiting with seniors in TX-07 and delivering Winter Wishes created by TX-07 students. I loved having a chance to see so many friendly faces and spread some holiday cheer! A huge thank you to everyone who participated. Our team works hard in Washington and in Houston every week. I'm glad to share a few team highlights, too, and to share many more in the year ahead! Anne-Marie and Maisy met with TV personality and former professional football player Colton Underwood to discuss mental health in sports. Cameron toured tunnels in Washington, D.C. with Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis which are useful as we assess how we address water conveyance in Houston and Harris County. Spencer and Bricen picked up Winter Wishes from some students who were very excited to share their holiday greetings! And Stephani stopped by the Greater Houston LGBT Chamber of Commerce Holiday Party. It is hard to believe that this year and this Congress are coming to an end. With holidays ahead, this will be my last weekly wrap up of 2022, and I want to take a moment to thank you for reading it and to thank the incredible team we have working for TX-07 that has helped make all this work possible. Our office will close at the end of this week and will reopen on January 3, 2023, but our team will still be available to help you. Please call my office at (713) 353-8680 or (202) 225-2571 or email here at any time to ask for assistance or to share your thoughts. When we reopen in the new year, we will be in new offices in Houston and in Washington. I look forward to sharing more information on that soon! As always, I am honored and proud to represent you. I look forward to hearing from you, seeing you, and partnering with you in the new year. Until then, I send warm wishes for a wonderful holiday season and a happy new year!

426," Bergman and Colleagues Call for Stop to Impending Medicare Cuts Bergman and Colleagues Call for Stop to Impending Medicare Cuts Last week, Representative Jack Bergman joined more than 80 members of Congress in sending a letter to House leadership urging action and offering any assistance necessary to prevent severe cuts to Medicare reimbursement for providers at the start of next year. These cuts would threaten the financial solvency of thousands of medical practices and make it impossible for many seniors to receive timely, quality care, especially in rural and remote parts of the . Bergman stated, ""It is unacceptable for Congress to force the burden of its own failures and inaction onto medical providers and patients. These sudden cuts to Medicare reimbursement will do irreparable harm to the hospitals, health clinics, doctor's offices, and other providers in Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula, especially as they continue to face health workforce shortages, inflation, and lingering effects of the pandemic. We must act now to prevent these cuts and protect access to health care for our seniors.""The letter says, in part: ""With an ongoing health care workforce shortage, American communities cannot afford to experience practice closures. Uncertain payment rates will only lead to physicians closing their doors and enhance the existing barriers to care these patients already face, exacerbating poorer quality of life for seniors.""Medicare reimbursement cuts currently set to come into effect on January 1st include a 4.5% across-the-board cut for doctors due to changes to the Physician Fee Schedule, as well as an additional 4% cut for all providers as a result of PAYGO rules following the budget reconciliation spending bill earlier this can read the letter in its entirety here.

428," Wicker Hails Passage of Defense Bill Legislation Will Boost Pay, Strengthen Forces, End Vaccine Mandate Our military service members can breathe a little easier now that the annual defense bill has finally passed. After months of unnecessary delays, the Senate on Thursday passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) by a vote of 83-11, authorizing a full year of military funding. This year's bill authorizes $858 billion for national security, sending a strong signal to our adversaries that we are serious about defending our country. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I wrote provisions of the bill that will support our defense industrial base and help grow our Navy fleet, enabling us to push back on Chinese aggression. This bill will go a long way toward keeping us safe. The final package is a win for our military, but it should never have taken so long to approve. The original bill passed out of committee in June, leaving months for congressional debate. Unfortunately, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer decided to shelve the bill for six months to focus on left-wing spending. Even last week, he insisted on diluting the defense bill with unrelated projects, such as an energy giveaway for West Virginia. This delay was reckless and irresponsible. Mr. Schumer's stall tactics have created needless delays for military construction projects and kept our troops from receiving a pay raise on time. Thankfully, Republicans stood firm and prevailed. I hope the Democratic Leader takes a lesson from this ordeal and begins treating our military with the seriousness it deserves. Putting Service Members First Our service members will benefit substantially from this legislation. The bill includes a much-needed 4.6 percent pay raise for our troops, helping to offset some of the damage from inflation. It will also repeal the Biden Administration's pointless COVID vaccine mandate, which has forced thousands of our best and brightest to leave the military prematurely. The Administration has continued to defend this mandate even as our military faces the worst manpower shortage in 50 years. I have urged the Pentagon to drop the mandate, and I voted for its repeal. Conservatives also successfully blocked parts of the left's social agenda. For the second year in a row, we successfully scrapped a provision that would have forced women to register for the draft - something I have long opposed. We also blocked a far-left attempt to reduce penalties for cocaine possession. In addition, I fought to include language clarifying that the military's role is to win wars, not to advance a social agenda. I will continue to fight against the President's woke liberal policies, which only weaken our military. Achieving Peace Through Strength With Russia and China growing more aggressive, we are now living in the most dangerous time since the height of the Cold War. It is vital that we maintain our military edge to prevent conflict. This year's legislation will modernize our nuclear capabilities, which President Biden's budget proposal would have weakened. It will also boost support for our allies who are on the front line against Chinese and Russian tyranny. One of my top priorities was a provision requiring at least 31 new amphibious ships for the Navy, many of which will be built in Mississippi. I also secured major investments in our state's military installations, including $10 million for Keesler Air Force Base and $20 million for the Army's Engineer Research and Development Center in Vicksburg. Mississippi has a key role to play in maintaining U.S. military superiority. With this bill now passed, we are well positioned to keep our enemies at bay in 2023.

430," Uncovering The Truth About COVID-19 Dear Friends, For over two years now, the American public has been gaslit and misled regarding the origins of COVID-19 and how the pandemic originated. To protect the American public from future pandemics, we need to get to the bottom of the origins of COVID-19 and do everything we can to prevent pandemics like this happening again. On December 14, 2022, Republicans on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) released our interim report on the origins of COVID-19. It states that COVID-19 may have been tied to China's bioweapons research program, and while our investigation did not find that COVID-19 was released intentionally, the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to stymie investigations and possibly conceal the truth were unethical and deeply , the Intelligence Community's lack of transparency with the American people and unwillingness to work in good faith with members of HPSCI is troubling - and something we will work to address in the 118th Congress.

SMART Copyright Act Will Protect Content Creation Last week, Representative Judy Chu (D-CA) and I introduced the SMART Copyright Act to protect the work of creators. This bipartisan legislation is designed to restore the intent of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to boost cooperation between creators and online platforms in the fight against digital piracy. Online platforms are important places for creators like musicians, authors, and filmmakers to share their content with consumers across the world. Unfortunately, online piracy has become prevalent and difficult to stop, jeopardizing content quality and the incentives to create it.

432," Open this e-mail in its own browser window Open a plain text version of this email News from Congressman Lamb Dear Friend, Being your representative in the United States Congress has been a great honor for me. When I first walked into the House chamber in 2018, I was struck by the fact that only two paintings hang there. One is of George Washington, and the other is of General Lafayette. Neither man ever served in the House, but there never would have been a House without them. Each day, I tried to make my service worthy of the brave Americans who have kept our democracy alive, including the police officers who died as a result of their defense of the Capitol on January 6. I also thought about you with every vote and every decision. Many of you took me into your homes, community centers, businesses, and schools, and you taught me things I needed to know in order to represent you well. The accomplishments described in the pages of my final district report all required your input, and my hope is that they reflect how seriously my staff and I took our obligation to you. Speaking of my staff, I want to thank them specifically. You may not know their names, but I wish you could have seen how dedicated they were to the basic task of making sure that your questions were answered, problems solved, and opinions considered. You would feel better about our government and the direction of our country if you saw them at work, and I am thrilled that many of them intend to stay in public service. My life has changed a lot since I first came to Congress. In 2019, I married my wife Hayley, and now we have two children, Matthew and Theodora. I am excited to spend more time with them, and I intend to remain active in our community. One last time, it has been a privilege being your representative. I am more convinced than ever that we are a great nation, blessed by God, and that if we simply act as Lincoln said, ""with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right,"" we will be just fine.

I'll keep fighting tooth and nail to stop the reckless spending, restore fiscal restraint in Washington, and get our economy back on track. New inflation data released this week confirmed that higher costs for everything from gas to groceries are here to stay. We can thank the Biden Administration and their reckless inflationary spending for the lack of cheer this Christmas season. We're nearly two years into Biden's economic crisis, and it's getting harder and harder for working-class Americans to put food on the table, clothes on their backs, and gasoline in their cars. The Republican House majority will focus on building a strong economy that increases wages, gets people back to work, and unleashes American energy. CLICK HERE to read how outrageous government spending led to another record-breaking inflation report this month that will affect all American families this Christmas season. The American people fired Nancy Pelosi. In just a few short weeks when the GOP takes the majority, we will rein in the reckless spending and start taking America in a new direction!

When Brennik was an infant, he spent 12 days at the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital in Iowa City when he was diagnosed at birth with Hirschsprung's disease. This is an intestinal disease that is present at birth and that can lead to death. Thanks to the excellent doctors at the hospital, Brennik's life was saved, but he will always have to manage life with the disease. Brennik did not let this disease deter him. Rather, he made it his mission to help other children who have chronic illnesses. Last year alone, Brennik raised over $2,000 for the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital in Iowa City. This money was used to buy books for children who are undergoing hospitalization and treatment. Brennik's selflessness did not go unnoticed by his community. The American Legion recently awarded Brennik with the Good Deed Award, which is gifted to youth who serve as an inspiration for their community. Also this week, University of Iowa's Jack Campbell was named to the All-American Football Team and being recognized as this year's Butkus Award winner, the first in the university's history. This is not Jack's first accolade. He was also named the Butkus-Fitzgerald Big Ten Linebacker of the Year award recipient as well as the Nagurski-Wooden Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, and he received the William V. Campbell Trophy throughout his 4 years with the Hawkeyes. This season, Jack had 118 tackles, two interceptions, one recovered fumble, and one forced fumble. Jack was pivotal in leading the defensive lineup to be named one of the best in the country, making him very deserving of these awards. Jack is another example of the University of Iowa students excelling inside and outside of the classroom. To watch my floor speeches click HERE .

435," News from Rep. Davidson Home Contact Me Our District News About Member Dear Friends- Telephone Townhall I will be hosting a telephone townhall on Monday, December 19th, from 7:30 to 8:30 PM. I look forward to answering your questions and discussing the issues impacting Ohio's Eight District. Congress must hit the ground running in 2023 to tackle the challenges facing our nation, including the southern border crisis, record-high inflation, and rising crime. Your feedback is invaluable to me as I work with my colleagues in Congress to address these crucial issues. I hope you will join us on Monday evening. Please sign up here or call my office to participate in the telephone townhall. Continuing Appropriations This week, House Democrats passed a week-long continuing resolution to keep the federal government funded through December 23rd. The original deadline was September 30th, then extended to December 16th, but Congress once again missed its deadline. If Democrats were proud of this government funding bill, they would have voted on it before the election. Instead of using these deadline extensions to negotiate a deal, Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer are trying to force Congress to make a bad deal by bringing the country to the brink of a government shutdown. For decades, this process has been used to increase spending, defer addressing important issues, and deflect accountability from elected officials. The House Republican majority next Congress must bring back the regular appropriations process if we have any hope of reigning in Washington's spending addiction. FTX Hearing FTX was one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges until it declared bankruptcy on December 11th. FTX's collapse shocked the financial services industry and revealed massive corporate fraud on behalf of FTX's CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. Mr. Bankman-Fried was going to testify at the Financial Services Committee before my colleagues and me, but he was arrested in the Bahamas the day before the hearing this week. While I had hoped to question Mr. Bankman-Fried, I did have the opportunity to question FTX's new CEO, John J. Ray, regarding how FTX defrauded its customers. Mr. Ray called FTX's corporate dysfunction the worst he has seen, despite the fact that he oversaw Enron's bankruptcy proceedings. You can watch the entirety of my conversation with John Ray here: Government Censorship Over the last two weeks, Elon Musk has released information regarding how Twitter coordinated with the federal government to censor users. Twitter limited the reach of users' posts, stopped their hashtags from trending, and in extreme cases, removed them from the platform. Conservatives were often the targets of this censorship. While private corporations can create their own standards for governing conduct on their platforms, federal officials cannot intervene in these decisions without implicating the First Amendment. From politicians, to law enforcement, to intelligence officials, we have learned that numerous government officials requested Twitter to censor Americans. It is unconstitutional for government officials to police speech this way, and Congress should investigate the government's involvement in Twitter's censorship decisions. Thank you for taking the time to keep up with the work I am doing on your behalf in Washington and at home in Ohio. I encourage you to stay connected with our office through my website , Facebook , Instagram , and Twitter pages. It is an honor to represent you.

I voted against this measure not because I want a government shutdown but because Congress is getting too comfortable kicking the can down the road. House Democrats cut out House Republicans every step of the way and delayed a final appropriations bill until after the election to hide their costly wish list items. They want to pass this bill at the eleventh hour while America sleeps, so they can ram through trillions of dollars in new reckless spending to fund their failed agenda. House Republicans will hold the line. You already spoke, and you want a NEW direction. So, in just 19 days, House Republicans will provide a check on the Biden Administration, rein in reckless spending, and work to restore fiscal responsibility in Washington. Please read about my week below: Top Reads of the Week A Recap of My Week Updates from Agencies Top Reads of the Week WMBB (PANAMA CITY): Florida cop treated for overdose after possible fentanyl exposure, police say (VIDEO) FLORIDA DAILY: Florida Delegation Requests Relief For Specialty Crop Insurance Providers WALL STREET JOURNAL: Utility Bills Rise as Americans Pay Off Storm-Recovery Costs for Decades to Come A Recap of My Week GOP Doctors Caucus I recently joined the GOP Doctors Caucus on a letter to House leadership requesting support for policies to address impending Medicare payment cuts in legislation moving through the U.S. House of Representatives before the end of the year. We are concerned about the impact of Medicare cuts in rural and underserved communities. With an ongoing healthcare workforce shortage, American communities cannot afford to experience practice closures. Uncertain payment rates will only lead to physicians closing their doors and enhance the existing barriers to care these patients already face, exacerbating poorer quality of life for seniors. Updates From Agencies Update from the IRS The Internal Revenue Service reminds employers and self-employed individuals that chose to defer paying part of their 2020 Social Security tax liability that their second annual installment of the deferred amount is due on December 31, 2022 . As part of the COVID relief provided during 2020, employers could choose to put off paying the employer's share of their Social Security tax liability, which is 6.2% of wages. Self-employed individuals could also choose to defer a similar amount of their self-employment tax. Generally, half of that deferral was due on December 31, 2021. The other half is due on December 31, 2022. Read more here . Help is available. You are not alone. The holiday season can be a difficult time for many.

439," Meet Richard | How Can I Help You? | Issues | Media Center | Conta ct me Friends, Another year is drawing to a close. In 2022, we've seen the best of our community come together, and we've had our fair share of challenges. Across the country, this year we've seen the highest inflation rates in 40 years and record high costs at the gas pump. These are both due in large part to misguided policy decisions by Washington Democrats. Additionally, we have seen a humanitarian and national security crisis at our southern border, as record numbers of illegal migrants crossed into the country this past year. This border crisis has created a worsening fentanyl epidemic in every community, robbing countless young Americans of their future - just as communities are also facing drastic increases in violent crime. The world has also been cast into greater turmoil, due in part to the United States projecting weakness. The disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan contributed to Putin's decision to wage war in Ukraine and Communist China's increasing aggression toward its neighbors. The Biden administration and Congressional Democrats have been largely unable to solve these problems or, in some cases, have made them worse. Time and time again, Washington Democrats have failed to address inflation, energy security, the border crisis, crime, or the increasingly tense international environment. Instead, they have doubled down on misguided policies or prioritized a leftist agenda that infringes on your liberties. This includes their so-called "" Inflation Reduction Act,"" a $740 billion bill that will raise your taxes, grow federal bureaucracy, and - in spite of the name - make inflation worse. However, Republicans have a plan to change our nation's direction for the better. In January, we will hold the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and have a plan to build an economy that's strong, a nation that's safe, a government that's accountable, and a future built on freedom. But for us to follow through on our ""Commitment to America,"" we must stand united. We have a duty to govern effectively and pursue the reforms needed to push America in the right direction, beginning with stopping out-of-control and inflation-driving spending. You elected me your representative to be a consensus builder and get things done. While 2022 was challenging, I am proud I was able to deliver real results for our community over the past 365 days. I have had 9 bills pass the sharply divided House this year and 5 signed into law. In total, I have had 24 bills pass the House and 10 signed into law during this Congress. These include measures like the Patient Advocate Tracker Act and the Camp Lejeune Justice Act. One piece of legislation I was proud to see become law was my bipartisan MOBILE Health Care Act . This new law increases access to affordable, quality health care in rural and underserved areas by allowing community health centers to use grants to establish mobile health units. This commonsense legislation will go a long way in improving health care quality and access. Despite all the troubles of this past year, we also witnessed triumphs of the human spirit. Just two weeks ago, an unknown individual or individuals attacked two power substations in Moore County, leaving numerous hospitals, schools, businesses, and close to 45,000 residents without power. Like many of you, my house was without power for almost a week. Yet throughout this ordeal, numerous businesses, local institutions, and individuals stepped up to help their neighbors and lend a hand. This show of compassion filled me with hope and reminded me that the future for our community and nation are bright. As Hanukkah begins and the Christmas holiday nears, I hope the joy of this time of year fills you and your family with happiness. I also hope you are proud of my efforts to defend our rights, stand up for our values, and push for common sense. I look forward to 2023 and the chance to conti nue to work for you. Together, we will get our country back on the right track.

440," Origins of COVID-19 This week, my colleagues and I on the the House Intelligence Committee released a report on the origins of COVID-19. The report indicates that COVID-19 could be connected to China's biological weapons research program and may have leaked into the human population during an accident at China's Wuhan Institute of Virology. The report highlights the failure of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) in withholding key information from the American people and their elected officials, deepening public mistrust. Every American's life has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Over one million Americans died, businesses were forced to close, and livelihoods were destroyed. Government mismanagement has led to education delays for kids across the nation and a dramatic increase in mental health issues. This report bolsters the lab leak theory, which many government officials, Big Tech platforms, and media outlets previously labeled a conspiracy theory. It marks significant progress towards giving the American people answers they deserve. In the 118th Congress, the Republican majority will continue this critical work. We must make every effort to ensure that our country is never vulnerable to similar threats again. And we must hold China accountable for its errors, its refusal to provide prompt disclosure to the US and the world about COVID-19's release, and its continued stonewalling of investigations into these issues. Read the full report here.

Still, the coming of the New Year and the start of a new Congress offer us a chance to redouble our efforts to fight for policies that put America back on the path to prosperity. That's why I made a Commitment to America to continue working to fight inflation, strengthen our economy, support our farmers, unleash American energy, secure the border, and deliver a brighter future for our nation. While there are surely challenges ahead of us, I know our best days are ahead of us, too. I am very proud of the work our team has done over the past year to serve the people of GA-12. In the past twelve months, our office resolved over 1,500 constituent cases, responded to more than 65,000 letters, and returned roughly $13.7 million to our district. But our work is far from over. As we recommit ourselves to delivering results for Georgia's 12th District, please know that our first priority is and will always be you, the outstanding people who call our district home. Sincerely, Rick Allen Member of Congress Honoring Senator Isakson's memory On Wednesday, I had the great honor of speaking during a ceremony to celebrate the signing of S. 4359, which renames the VA Regional Office Building in Atlanta after the late, great Senator Johnny Isakson, into law. Sen. Isakson set an example of diligence, bipartisanship, and compassion throughout his career in public service. For these reasons - coupled with his tireless efforts to support America's veterans - this bill marks a fitting tribute to his considerable legacy, and I was proud to co-lead its companion bill in the House. Defending independent contractors from Biden's DOL I recently spoke during a press call hosted by the Independent Women's Forum about the Department of Labor's proposed rule to strip flexibilities currently enjoyed by millions of independent contractors by reclassifying them as traditional employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act . I also joined my colleagues in sending a letter to Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, calling out the many reasons this proposed rule would harm the more than 60 million Americans who currently earn their living as independent contractors. Pioneer for Prosperity Award On Wednesday, I was humbled to receive the Pioneer for Prosperity Award from Americans for Prosperity, which is presented to Members of Congress for ""proactively advancing principles and policies that offer solutions to Americans facing barriers to their upward mobility and success."" As your Congressman, I will never stop fighting to protect pathways to the American Dream.

Part of this promise is to ensure we protect American's constitutional rights and hold the Biden Administration accountable. This means defending free speech, protecting the lives of unborn children, and upholding the Second Amendment. House Republicans will also work to provide real transparency to the American people and demand the White House answer for its failures at home and abroad. Click here or on the image below to learn more about our commitment to the American people. One of the ways I will uphold this commitment is through my role as the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. During last week's committee hearing with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Rohit Chopra, I outlined how the incoming House Republican majority will pursue aggressive oversight to rein in the unaccountable CFPB. Director Chopra is implementing progressive policies at the expense of American consumers and we are committed to stopping them.

What I've Been Reading Biden braces for potentially 14,000 migrants a day Axios Our country cannot afford politically motivated policies that make our borders less secure, weaken the rule of law, and damage public health. But those are exactly the kind of policies President Biden has enacted since day one of his presidency, which has dangerously accelerated the crisis at the southern border. There is a growing threat of an overwhelming influx of migrants at our southern border-even worse than the historic influx we've seen so far-with numbers reaching as high as 14,000 border crossings a day. We need an end to radical far-left policies that threaten the security of the American people. Cuban Missile Crisis veterans honored Mt.

443," December 18, 2022 Dear Georgian, Last week we celebrated the National Guard's 386th Birthday. To our guardsmen who serve or have served, thank you for your service to our great nation. I want to thank U.S. Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro for naming a ship in honor of the heroes of the 2004 battles of Fallujah - USS Fallujah. I am proud to have sponsored an amendment in both the House-passed versions of the FY22 and 23 NDAAs calling for this recognition of many heroes. This name honors the bravery and courage of the U.S. military members who fought valiantly in these two battles during the Iraq War in 2004. In total, over 100 Americans made the ultimate sacrifice in these battles. This ship's name will remind us of the incredible bravery of our heroic men and women in uniform and the debt of gratitude we forever owe them. As always, my staff and I are here to help. If you need assistance with a federal agency or have comments or concerns to share with me, please do not hesitate to call my Warner Robins, Tifton, or Washington, D.C. offices.

I first met Johnny when I was 18 years old, and he was a friend and role model to me for most of my life. Every Member of Congress should strive to follow the example that the Senator set for us.

The Georgia National Guard has maintained a strong cooperation with the armed services of the country of Georgia since 1994 through the National Guard's State Partnership Program. I expressed my appreciation and admiration for the bravery of the Georgian military, and we discussed the importance of continued cooperation between our nations as we work together to end Putin's criminal war of aggression and Russia's illegal occupation in Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova.

Lowndes County recently recognized David Corbett of South Georgia Produce as their Large Farmer of the Year, and Janet and Steve Hendley of Fifth Day Farm were named the Small Farmer of the year. David Corbett began working on the family farm with his parents and started South Georgia Produce in 1993. His farm supplies fresh produce to U.S. markets, including summer squash, zucchini, eggplant, bell peppers, specialty peppers, cucumbers, and cabbage. All three of his children have worked in various capacities within the farm and are still actively involved today. Fifth Day Farm started in 2017 in the Hendley's backyard and is now a popular agritourism destination in Lowndes County. The farm has a petting zoo where people can interact with donkeys, chickens, and pigs and even go to goat yoga. Fifth Day Farm has taught many people in Lowndes and beyond about farms, farm animals, and agriculture. Please join me in congratulating these farmers on their achievements and thanking them for their work to support Georgia's number one industry! You can read more here .

445," This week, President Biden celebrated November's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, About Me Contact Services Media Center Issues High Inflation Hurting Hardworking Americans Dear Texans, This week, President Biden celebrated November's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed that Americans are still suffering under high inflation. 7.1% inflation is nothing to brag about, yet President Biden has claimed it as an achievement. Make no mistake, inflation is a tax on all Americans, and Democrats' massive expansion of government spending has fueled rampant inflation and has put heavy financial strains on Main Street America. As we near the final days of the one-party Democrat rule in Washington, Republicans are ready to rein in reckless spending and work to restore fiscal sanity in Washington.

446," December 18, 2022 Dear Floridian: This week, I joined my House GOP colleagues and Trump Administration Immigration officials at a press conference held in support of impeaching U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in the 118th Congress. 98 individuals on the terror watchlist have been apprehended on our Southern border, and Secretary Mayorkas told the Judiciary Committee he didn't know whether DHS had released the known terrorists into our country. Releasing known terrorists into our country is surely an impeachable offense. I advocated on Thursday to eliminate gun free zones during our Judiciary Subcommittee hearing. 94% of mass shootings between 1950 and 2019 occurred in Gun Free Zones. To prevent evil individuals from targeting locations where they know every person is defenseless, we must eliminate Gun Free Zones. I joined my colleagues in demanding that the Department of Justice address their bias in responding to attacks on pro-life centers. Since the unprecedented leak of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , radical abortion advocates have targeted and threatened institutions who support the right to life. There is a clear difference in how the DOJ has responded to these attacks and how they've responded in the past to attacks on abortion providers. Partisanship should not be allowed to flourish at the DOJ. I firmly believe that Congress should not pass an omnibus in the lame duck because the new Republican majority should certainly have a say in our appropriations process. I opposed the one-week Continuing Resolution. It would be a great disservice to the American people should Republicans allow the Democrats one last opportunity to control the appropriations process, when we can instead craft it with conservative policies in a few short weeks.

447," It is a privilege to serve the 23rd Congressional District of Texas in Congress. Each day, I work to address your concerns and protect our liberties. Please read below for some updates on my recent work representing you in Washington, D.C. and back home in TX-23. THE HAPPENINGS IN CONGRESS Introduced the TAPS Act This year, 14 U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents and officers have taken their own life - that is 14 too many. Our men and women in green and blue are spending their days working long hours and responding to high-stress situations, and it is pushing them to a breaking point. That's why I am proud to introduce the TAPS Act (Taking Action to Prevent Suicide). This bipartisan legislation will prioritize mental health and help prevent the loss of another life. Click here for the full bill text and background. Sent a Bipartisan Letter Urging Biden to Extend Title 42 Title 42 is set to end in less than a week, and migrants are already gathering at our borders in record numbers. Unfortunately things will only get worse, and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are recognizing the crisis. That's why I joined Senator John Cornyn, Senator Joe Manchin, and Congressman Henry Cuellar in writing a bipartisan letter urging Biden to extend Title 42. Repealing this last line of defense without a plan is a recipe for disaster. Read the full letter here . Discussed Bipartisan Border Solutions I sat down with Troy Miller, Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Representative Henry Cuellar to discuss tangible, bipartisan solutions to the crisis that is happening at our southern border. Instead of playing political football, I am committed to working across the aisle and having discussions like these to help my constituents who are living in this chaos everyday. Traveled to Mexico to Celebrate 200 Years of Bilateral Relations I recently traveled to Mexico to celebrate the 200 year anniversary of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Mexico. It is important that we recognize the cultural and economic impact this partnership has on both countries. Together we can build upon our long-standing ties and continue to work closely in areas such as energy, trade, and economic development. Celebrated the Passage of the Blackwell School National Historic Site Act This week I met with Cary Dupuy of the National Parks Conservation Association and Gretel Enk of the Blackwell School Alliance to celebrate the passage of my bill, the Blackwell School National Historic Site Act. It is important that we continue to educate and bring awareness to the significance of this historic site for years to come. Discussed US-Mexico Relations With Dr. Tony Payan This week I sat down with Dr. Tony Payan, Director of the Center for the United States and Mexico at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. We discussed US-Mexico relations and issues ranging from immigration and border security to trade and labor. Brought Books to Students at Horizon Heights Elementary School This week my team visited Horizon Heights Elementary School to drop off books from the Library of Congress. The students were very excited to pick out their favorite new books to read! 2022 CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE I am excited to announce our district's 2022 Congressional App Challenge winner Daniel Curtis. His app focuses on mental health, allowing users to get quick access to crisis hotlines, participate in mindfulness exercises like journaling and meditation, and track day to day progress. Each year, competitions like the Congressional App Challenge showcase the creativity of TX-23 students. The talent in our district is unmistakable, and I am excited to see this generation channel their talent into solving problems facing our nation and helping others to connect and cope through technology.

Joining C-SPAN's Washington Journal to Discuss Spending, Debt, and Our Commitment to America This week I joined C-SPAN's Washington Journal call-in program to discuss government spending, our national debt, and House Republicans' Commitment to America. It was great to speak with constituents from our congressional district during the program, answer their questions, and discuss the important issues facing our nation. Click this link or the image below to listen to the program. Lancaster District Office is Moving My Lancaster district office has moved to 2270 Erin Court, Lancaster, PA 17601 and will be fully operational on January 3, 2023. My staff will continue to offer constituent services uninterrupted by the move. Our new office has ample access to free parking and is easily accessible to constituents, located directly off the Rohrerstown Road exit of Route 30, which is the main thoroughfare connecting Lancaster and York counties.

Legislation to Support Mothers and Children Advances I am thankful that the House recently passed H.R. 8876, the Jackie Walorski Maternal and Child Home Visiting Reauthorization Act of 2022. The legislation was named in honor of the late Rep. Jackie Walorski, my friend and colleague, who proudly represented Indiana's 2nd Congressional District from 2013 until her passing in August. The bipartisan bill reauthorizes the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program, increases federal investment over five years, and strengthens the focus on evidence-based home visiting models and practices. In Pennsylvania, MIECHV provides funding to the Nurse Family Partnership, which has helped thousands of women, families, and babies across our community learn the skills they need to create better futures. The model has proven outcomes to help families become economically self-sufficient and improve school readiness for children, setting them up for a lifetime of success. I recently visited with families in Lancaster who are participating in the program and saw firsthand the positive impact it is having on the lives of mothers and their children. I am thankful the House joined together to honor Jackie's legacy and pass this important legislation to empower and assist families. Click here to learn more about the legislation. Legislation Introduced to Protect Adopting Families from Unnecessary Audits This week I joined Rep. Blake Moore of Utah in introducing the Protecting Adopting Families from Audits Act of 2022. Our legislation will provide Congress the information needed to ensure administration of the Adoption Tax Credit is fair and does not pose unnecessary burdens to those who adopt. According to a previous report of the National Taxpayer Advocate Service, roughly 70 percent of families claiming the Adoption Tax Credit were audited by the IRS. An IRS audit is no way to show thanks to families who are adopting children. I thank Rep. Moore for advancing this important legislation. Click here to learn more.

449," Green Mountain Orchards and the Darrow Family Dear Fellow Vermonter, I confess. I love Vermont apples (and apple cider, apple pie, cider donuts, etc.) and very much appreciate those who tend the orchards that produce them. Today, as part of our tribute to Vermont agriculture, the Bernie Buzz is focusing on the beautiful Green Mountain Orchards in Putney owned by the Darrow family. Now one of the largest orchards in Vermont, the Darrow family has planted, nurtured, and harvested a wide variety of apples in the hills that have made up Green Mountain Orchards since 1914. For four generations, the Darrows and their team have worked hard to keep the orchard running. Since then, it has become a beloved spot for the community and visitors alike, who come not just for the apples but for the blueberries, peaches, fir trees, cider press, and bakery - as well as the opportunity to enjoy the beautiful grounds. Before the end of the season, the Bernie Buzz was able to visit Green Mountain Orchards, speak with some of the Darrows about their family business and history - and of course, try their apple cider donuts. I hope you will watch the video above to learn more. Sincerely, How Can We Help? My Vermont offices have experienced caseworkers on staff who help Vermonters navigate federal agencies every day.

451," News from Representative Speier Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window Click here to open a plain text version of this email December 18, 2022 Dear Friends, This week we celebrated that love is love with President Joe Biden signing into law the Respect for Marriage Act. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation protects the rights of LGTBQ+ and interracial couples to marry and is now the law of the land. We also celebrated the historic leadership of the greatest Speaker of the House with the unveiling of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's portrait. It was a wonderful moment to behold as former House Speaker and Republican John Boehner toasted his respected colleague and longtime friend. Speaker Pelosi and Former Speaker Boehner showed that we can not only work together with our colleagues from across the aisle, we can also disagree without being disagreeable. In more somber news, this week marked the 10-year anniversary of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. It's hard to believe that it's been a decade since 20 first graders and six adults were murdered by a gunman. Since then, we've suffered at least 27 more mass school shootings, including the tragedy that unfolded in Uvalde, Texas earlier this year and where 19 children and two adults were murdered. As a survivor of gun violence, I know what it's like to live with the physical and emotional scars of gun violence. I've seen what it does to families, communities, and our national psyche. Yet we've made only painfully slow progress on this issue. Congress must do more, starting with banning assault weapons and ensuring children cannot get their hands on guns. The time for thoughts and prayers and moments of silence are over. Every time Democrats utter these platitudes and participate in these meaningless ceremonies, we are complicit with Republicans' inaction on this national crisis. We have much more work ahead of us in Washington as we prepare to close out the 117th Congress, including our push for Senate leadership to hold a vote on the Pregnant Worker's Fairness Act before the year is over. Ensuring the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act gets a vote in the Senate is a public health and economic imperative. It's supported by faith organizations, maternal health groups, business associations, labor unions, and women's and civil rights organizations. It's also overwhelmingly bipartisan, passing the House nearly a year a half ago on a vote of 315 to 101. Yet workers in America continue to suffer miscarriages because they can't get reasonable accommodations granted to other workers. Given the strong Republican support for the bill in the House, we are confident it will pass the Senate given the chance. And I continue to work on behalf of my constituents at home, where I've had the honor and privilege of meeting with many of you at my recent town halls held in Burlingame, Half Moon Bay, and South San Francisco. I look forward to providing my final report card on my work in Congress, and nearly 40 years of elected service, at my fourth and final event scheduled for 1 p.m. this Sunday in Redwood City. I may be retiring from Congress, but I am not retiring from fighting the good fight on behalf of everyone here at home. I encourage you to join me in that fight, and in making good trouble, for the benefit of all Americans. One way to do that is to ensure we're well-informed with verified, factual reporting. By doing this, and working together, we can and will overcome all obstacles.

Before and after Sandy Hook: 40 years of elementary school shooting survivors On the 10th anniversary of the massacre in Newtown, Conn., four survivors of elementary school shootings, ages 52 to 10, talk about what it's done to them. By John Woodrow Cox, The Washington Post Ten years ago, on Dec. 14, 2012, a man walked into Sandy Hook Elementary and opened fire, killing 20 first-graders and six adults in what many people thought to be a singular event: a school shooting so horrific that nothing like it could ever happen again. That massacre, of course, was not the last one at an elementary school - but it also wasn't the first. Most Americans know what happened on that day in Newtown, Conn., and then again a decade later in Uvalde, Tex., where 19 kids and two teachers died in May. What far fewer know is that for more than 40 years, people with guns have been killing this country's youngest children in the places they go to learn and grow. Gun violence at elementary schools remains rare, but thousands of American kids have experienced it. To capture what that's done to them in the days, years and decades afterward, The Washington Post interviewed four survivors who endured shootings before any of them reached fifth grade. Each has been shaped by what they saw and heard and lost: the 52-year-old from California who has spent more than half his life pleading with parole boards not to release the woman who shot him when he was in fourth grade; the 40-year-old from South Carolina who waited three decades to talk about the day her first-grade teacher was wounded in front of her; the 19-year-old from Connecticut who doesn't always know what to say when strangers ask if she saw the dead bodies at Sandy Hook; the 10-year-old from Texas who hid under a table earlier this year as his best friends at Robb Elementary were killed in front of him.

Texas attorney general's office sought state data on transgender Texans By Molly Hennessy-Fiske, The Washington Post HOUSTON - Employees at the Texas Department of Public Safety in June received a sweeping request from Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton's office: Compile a list of individuals who had changed their gender on their Texas driver's license and other department records during the past two years. ""Need total number of changes from male to female and female to male for the last 24 months, broken down by month,"" the chief of the DPS's driver license division emailed colleagues in the department on June 30, according to a copy of a message obtained by The Washington Post through a public records request. ""We won't need DL/ID numbers at first but may need to have them later if we are required to manually look up documents."" After more than 16,000 such instances were identified, DPS officials determined that a manual search would be needed to determine the reason for the changes, DPS spokesman Travis Considine told The Post in response to questions. ""A verbal request was received,"" he wrote in an email. ""Ultimately, our team advised the AG's office the data requested neither exists nor could be accurately produced. Thus, no data of any kind was provided."" Asked who in Paxton's office had requested the records, he replied: ""I cannot say."" To read the complete article, click here . US, Japan left behind thousands of bombs after WWII. They're still exploding and killing people in the Pacific. By Thomas Heaton, USA Today Coconut crabs roast atop a sheet of roofing iron, heated by a fire below, as the Manele family prepares for a typical Monday night dinner in Guadalcanal, an island in the South Pacific Ocean. Standing next to the fire which has been set at the foot of the stairs leading up to the house, John Manele, a subsistence farmer, chats with his sons - 13-year-old Junior Dominic and 17-year-old Jeffry - as the sun goes down. A few yards away, Loretta Manele, the boys' mother, fixes the rest of the meal next to the family's traditional thatched-hut kitchen. The cooking fire snaps. It cracks again. Then it explodes. The blast hurls the four Maneles off the ground, sending them flying. The blazing airborne metal mangles John and Junior. John dies where he lies, Junior in a hospital, two hours later. When Jeffry comes to, he finds himself beside his mother, her legs scorched and pocked with shrapnel. To read the complete article, click here . One huge trial proved the 4-day workweek can be successful. Will it take off in the Bay Area? By Carolyn Said, San Francisco Chronicle At San Francisco startup Bolt, all 550 employees work four days a week, earning the same amount for 32 hours as when they put in a traditional 40-hour week. They use the extra day however they like: taking three-day weekend trips, running errands, volunteering, chilling or even going on adventures together like a recent outing to a rock-climbing gym. Bolt, which provides one-click checkout for e-commerce sites, first experimented with the four-day workweek a year ago at its founder's behest. ""It was a trial to see if well-being increased and if productivity stayed the same or increased,"" said spokesperson Stephanie Tan. ""People loved it; we were still hitting all our goals as a company. You get the best of both worlds. Monday to Thursday, you are working way more efficiently than you would spreading it out over five days."" Bolt is among a few hundred companies worldwide that are pioneering an attempt to radically reduce the workweek. Advocates say the four-day week is a natural evolution from remote work and that it even improves efficiency by cutting out unnecessary meetings and busy work, as well as increasing worker satisfaction. Sacramento lawmakers this year briefly considered, and then dropped, a bill to enshrine the concept. At the federal level, a California congressman introduced similar legislation last year, saying it's an idea whose time has come. However, many economists and employers groups deplore the concept as anathema to a competitive economy. To read the complete article, click here .

We cannot fathom the loss. Please join me in prayer for Sheriff Lamb and his family: Dear Lord, bless those in mourning. Bring comfort to Sheriff Lamb and his family with the knowledge that nothing good created by God can be destroyed. Bring peace to him with the knowledge that their memories will bring joy, that their time on earth enriched us all, and that they will be reunited one day in heaven.

The FBI Was a ""Subsidiary"" of Twitter The social media giant, Twitter, has been under an internal investigation started by its new owner, Elon Musk. The investigation has revealed a massive conspiracy, enacted by hundreds of Twitter employees, to attack and suppress President Trump, interfere with the 2020 and 2022 elections, promote fraud and misinformation related to COVID-19, and to censor conservatives. Thousands of conservatives had their accounts suspended for fraudulent reasons, all done with malice to hurt conservative candidates. More shocking, however, is the recent release of additional information in which it appears that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was working within Twitter to interfere with the 2020 and 2022 elections. You read that right. Not Russia. Not Ukraine. Not China. Our own FBI plotted and schemed to interfere with the elections by censoring candidates and conservative voices. Investigative reporter Matt Taibii concluded that the FBI involvement ""was constant and pervasive, as if it were a subsidiary. Between January 2020 and November 2022, there were over 150 emails between the FBI and former Twitter Trust and Safety Chief Yoel Roth,"" demanding Twitter to take action to censor people. Government censorship is illegal. The FBI's partnering with a private company does not make it any less illegal. Stay tuned in 2023. I will be investigating this devious misconduct and criminality. COVID-19 Vaccine Studies Highlight Harm If you missed my special midweek newsletter , I highlighted a series of recent medical studies detailing the harm caused by the COVID-19 experimental vaccine. If you have the time, go back and read it. One study by the Journal of Medical Ethics analyzed medical data among college students aged 18 to 29 years old and found that those forced to receive the vaccine or booster were likely to incur 18 ""serious adverse events"" generated by the vaccine, including grave illnesses and death. Another recent report from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) found that majority of recent COVID-19 related deaths were of those vaccinated and boosted people. There is late breaking news since I issued my midweek newsletter. A government watchdog group, the Protect the Public's Trust, filed a complaint this Friday alleging the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ""has committed scientific integrity violations"" by refusing to track the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. The CDC is mandated to provide Americans with accurate scientific data, weather harmful or safe. Instead, the report validates what I have been saying for the past few years: the CDC is in bed with Big Pharma and is engaging in a cover up to further its political agenda and the American people have lost all trust with the agency whose mission is to supply trustworthy data. Click here to read the complaint filed by the Protect the Public's Trust. Gosar Receives 100% rating from Multiple Conservative Groups As the waning days of congress wrap up, the 2022 voting scorecards are out and I am proud to say that I continue to fight for America First and conservative values since I entered Congress in 2011. From protecting your Second Amendment to blocking the constant stampede of illegal aliens to defending the traditional family, there were many causes to champion for the residents of the 4 th congressional district. The contentment of advocacy organizations has been reflected in their vote scorecards evaluating me. Gun Owners of America , NumbersUSA, F reedomWorks , Turning Point Action and Heritage Action all gave me the highest score possible. I encourage you to click on these important scorecards and see how I voted on key issues and compare it to others in our state and around the country. Please know that I will continue to fight for your God-given rights this upcoming Congress. Gosar Votes Against Latest Budget Ploy This week, Congress voted on a what is called a Continuing Resolution, or CR, to fund the budget for one more week. Nothing more perfectly describes how broken congress is than the fact that we are three months into FY 2023 and the federal government is still operating under a CR. I voted against this broken process that kicks the can down the road while our economy teeters towards the brink of a long recession. This one-week deal gives Democrats in the majority more time to negotiate behind closed doors on a massive year-long funding bill and gives democrats one final opportunity to pass their radical, woke agenda. Like the NDAA legislation I wrote about in last week's newsletter, no member of congress will have time to read or understand the full impact of this reckless funding bill. There will be no debate or thoughtful consideration. No amendments will be allowed. The federal government has a spending problem. I will not vote for any legislation which does not fully assess and implement cost cutting mechanisms in the budget. Good process builds good policy which makes good politics. Drafting a bill without legislative hearings and robust debates, that ignores the voice of the People and their representatives and which contains massive spending is terrible process and it will make for terrible policy. Here's a novel concept: I urge all members of Congress to work through regular order and pass appropriation bills individually and on time. Gosar Calls on Congress to Take Up Fentanyl Death Penalty Bill In light of the recent arrest of a man in Yavapai County , Arizona charged with manslaughter for selling lethal fentanyl, I once again called on congress to take up legislation I introduced that would punish a defendant with the death penalty or life in prison if convicted of selling or distributing fentanyl. Under my bill, the alleged drug dealer in Yavapai County would face the death penalty, not mere manslaughter, where he will be released in just a few years. Each passing day, fentanyl brings death and despair to communities across America, including in Arizona. Fentanyl now kills more Americans than car accidents, suicides or gun violence. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 196 Americans are dying each day from fentanyl and more than 2,000 pounds of the deadly drug pour across our open southern border every month, including more than 2,900 pounds this past November - the highest ever. It is long past time that those responsible for selling and distributing fentanyl pay a heavy price. Click here to read more about my legislation. Another Economic Disaster for America The economic numbers for the month of November have been released and it is more bad news. The Biden regime and its democrat enablers have created massive economic instability. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key inflation index, rose at an annual rate to 7.1%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. When Joe Biden assumed office, the CPI was just 1.4%. Then, after taking office, and after implementing lunatic fringe policies, inflation skyrocketed to 40-year highs because of Biden and democrats' out-of-control spending to fuel their far-Left agenda. In July 2021, Joe Biden told the American people inflation was just ""temporary"" after the CPI increased to 5.4% and White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain called inflation a ""high-class problem."" Of course they lied, and of course they could not have been more wrong. Let's take a closer look: BIDEN'S ECONOMIC CRISIS BY THE NUMBERS: Inflation is a tax on ALL Americans. Families across the country are still paying more for just about everything: Food at employee sites and schools is UP 110.1% Food at elementary and secondary schools is UP 254.1% Fuel oil is UP 65.7% Eggs are UP 49.1% Air fares are UP 36.0% Butter and margarine are UP 34.2% Flour is UP 24.9% Frozen and refrigerated bakery products, pies, tarts, turnovers are UP 19.4% Cookies are UP 19.2% Lunchmeats are UP 18.4% Cereals and bakery products are UP 16.4% Potatoes are UP 16.2% Bread is UP 15.7% Milk is UP 14.7% Rice is UP 14.1% Electricity is UP 13.7% Energy is UP 13.1% Real average hourly earnings decreased 1.9%, seasonally adjusted, from November 2021 to November 2022. The skyrocketing cost of goods and services will cost the average American household over $700 a month, which adds up to over $8,000 a year. When the House Republican majority is restored in January, I will fight inflation by reining in Joe Biden and House democrats' reckless government spending and promoting pro-growth tax policies. Team Gosar Welcomes Interstate Wharehousing to Kingman! Recently, my District Director, Penny Pew had the opportunity to attend the groundbreaking ceremony for Interstate Wharehousing's newest cold storage warehouse facility in Kingman. The groundbreaking represents a culmination of planning and collaboration between Interstate Wharehousing and many local leaders, whose leadership made this project possible. This strategically located facility will provide dozens of good paying jobs, infuse millions of dollars of capital investment into the region and allow for the continual growth of our community right here in Kingman. Congratulations and welcome to Kingman! It's Mail Time! I received a lot of mail this year. In fact, as this year ends, I have received nearly 75,000 letters! I love hearing from everyone. Here's a sampling of some of those letters I received this week! Barry W. from Prescott, AZ shared is thoughts on the fentanyl crisis: Finally, a bill that will treat the fentanyl crisis as the war that it needs to be. Dear Barry - thanks for your note. The fentanyl crisis is destroying families and communities. I held a fentanyl roundtable earlier this year and heard from heart-broken family members detailing their agonizing pain and loss caused by fentanyl. It begins with sealing our porous southern border and holding those accountable for manufacturing and distributing this illicit drug. Rich H. from Flagstaff, AZ wrote in: Thank you for your interest in this issue and serving in Congress to investigate it. I am increasingly alarmed by reports of the effects of the mRNA vaccines, and believe the American people are deserving of an investigation into all related issues. Here is a report I read just this morning from Just the News: > Rich, I agree with you. When the Republicans are sworn in next month, you can be sure I will be leading the charge for an investigation about all things related to COVID-19. Judi L. from Cornville, AZ shared this: Dear Congressman Gosar, Thank you for your continued stand for medical freedom in standing against the COVID 19 vaccines. Based on what I have read, the vaccines should no longer be given. For me, this also calls in the question of what other current medical interventions could also be ineffective or harmful. Hi, Judi. I have always said the that the decision to get the COVID-19 vaccine, or any vaccine for that matter, is between a doctor and the patient. I remain very troubled by the many reports detailing the side-effects of the COVID jab and the government's failure to accurately report those findings. Linda T. from Wickenburg expresses: Please, please vote NO on this [omnibus] bill. We do not want 2 trillion in discretionary spending. We don't have discretionary spending here at home and we don't think the government should have any right now. We do not want the ""woke"" defense authorization. This foolishness needs to stop by cutting off the money. We do not want the electoral defense act. Leave the elections to the states, where it belongs. VOTE NO! Dear Linda - you can be sure that I will not be voting for this Omnibus bill or ANY legislation that sets the stage for a ""lame duck"" fight on government funding gives democrats one final opportunity to pass that agenda. Tweet of the Week: Photo of the Week: Karen Gonzales from Fort Mohave, AZ shared this amazing photo of a sunset recently taken at Alamo Lake State Park while on a recent RV trip. Very peaceful, Karen! Thanks for sharing. Now, who is next!? Do you have photography skills? Do you want the chance for your photograph to be featured as our ""Picture of the Week?""

455," Latest Update from Rep. Rouzer Americans Deserve Transparency on the Origins of COVID-19 This past week, Republicans on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released a report indicating COVID-19 may have been tied to China's bioweapons research program. (In my opinion, there is no question about it.) The report contains critical discrepancies from the Intelligence Community's 2021 report on the possible origins of COVID-19, which claimed they were ""skeptical of allegations that SARS-CoV-2 was a biological weapon."" The Select Committee's report is an unclassified summary of the broader classified version. Highlights of the unclassified summary include:The investigation revealed serious shortcomings with both the classified and declassified versions of the Intelligence Community's (IC) Updated Assessment on COVID-19 Origins. The IC withheld key information from the public in the declassified version of its Updated Assessment, information that could have been shared without damaging national security. These omissions likely skewed the public's understanding of key issues. The Committee believes the IC downplayed important information relating to the possible links between COVID-19 and China's bioweapons research based in part on input from outside experts. Findings conclude that there are indications that SARS-CoV-2 may have been tied to China's biological weapons research program and spilled over to the human population during a lab-related incident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The Committee will seek to declassify the classified version of their report in the next Congress. In addition, the Committee plans to explore all means at its disposal to require the IC to fully cooperate and comply until their requests are met with adequate the 118th Congress, my fellow House Republican colleagues and I will demand answers on behalf of the American people as to why the Intelligence Community failed to share pertinent information with elected officials regarding the full truth behind the Chinese Communist Party's involvement with this pandemic that impacted millions of American families.

NC-07 Academy Nominations Our United States Service Academies provide the highest standard of undergraduate education and the training of commissioned officers for the United States Armed Forces. Each year, I look forward to nominating some of the best and brightest young men and women from across Southeastern North Carolina for consideration to attend a United States Service Academy. Congratulations to this year's outstanding group of students on their nominations! I wish them the best of luck as they move forward with the application process. Click here for a full list of this year's nominees. Supporting the McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program For two decades, the McGovern-Dole Program has improved education and reduced childhood hunger around the globe. McGovern-Dole has provided more than five and a half billion school meals benefitting over 31 million school-age children and their communities abroad. It also benefits our farm families and, in many ways, is a form of diplomacy and advertisement of the goodness of the American people. I have seen this program in action - and it is a special sight to see. Several years ago I joined the then Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee Mike Conaway to visit schools in third world countries where food is scarce and extreme poverty exists like you cannot believe. The visit clearly showed how imperative a nutritious meal is to a child's survival. Just as important, the McGovern-Dole program also provides an opportunity for them to learn, laying the foundation for an improved life and achievement. For many of these children from very poor means, the food provided at their school through this program is their only good meal of the day. I'm proud to celebrate its success, along with the hard work of the American farm families who make this program possible. Watch my full speech on the House Floor in support of this program below. This Week's Good News Story For this week's good news story, I'm congratulating the Wilmington Fire Department on their 125th anniversary! According to WECT , ""the department became a career organization on Dec. 1, 1897. At that time, the city had 30 firefighters and just three fire stations. Now, the department has nine stations and over 200 employees."" Over the 125 years of its existence, the Wilmington Fire Department has protected the citizens of Wilmington by responding to calls ranging from structure fires to medical emergencies. Their commitment and service to our community is beyond any measure of value. Please join me in thanking the Wilmington Fire Department for the work they do to protect our communities!

456," Dear Neighbor, Welcome to another edition of my newsletter. This has been a busy week in Washington, thank you for taking the time to read about my work to serve Pennsylvania's 13th District. If you would like to share my e-newsletters with others, please direct them to this link to subscribe. On Tuesday, I addressed the U.S. House of Representatives to draw attention to the ongoing fentanyl crisis in affecting millions of Americans across our country. In recent years, fentanyl has become easy to obtain and fast to kill. I have spoken with first responders, police officers, and coroners across our district who are alarmed by the potency of fentanyl and have reported that a single dose of Narcan is often not enough to reverse an overdose. We need to renew our efforts to address this crisis and provide first responders and medical professionals with the tools they need to keep our communities safe. To that end, I am a co-sponsor of the HALT Fentanyl Act (H.R. 6184), which would permanently classify illicit and counterfeit fentanyl as a class one substance and impose strict penalties on manufacturers and traffickers.

This week, I had the opportunity to meet with Pennsylvania Farm Bureau President Chris Hoffman to discuss economic sustainability, strengthening our supply chain, and the important role that farms play in our rural communities. In the next Congress, when Republicans hold the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, it's critical that we pass legislation to support the dairy farmers, growers, and producers who do so much to support our local economy. When seconds count, we need to make sure that our first responders and firefighters are able to communicate effectively. To do that, they need cell phone coverage no matter where they are across our district. Last week, I joined the Shade Gap Volunteer Fire Company and AT&T in Huntingdon County to roll out a new FirstNet cellphone tower that will help to ensure strong communication across parts of Huntingdon, Fulton, and Franklin Counties. This technology, developed following the September 11th attacks, helps to ensure that in an emergency, our first-responders are able to communicate with one another. To learn more, visit . On Monday, I had the opportunity to host a telephone town with over 15,000 constituents from across our district. One of the most important parts of my job is hearing directly from you, learning what issues matter most to you, and being able to communicate and represent your interests and concerns on Capitol Hill. Topics discussed on the call ranged from our recent votes in Congress to fund our military, increasing access to quality healthcare, and House Republicans' Commitment to America and plans for the next session of Congress, which begins on January 3, 2023. Special thanks to all who joined in the town hall, and be on the look out for additional town halls in the new year! Thank you to The Chamber of Gettysburg & Adams County for inviting me to their annual Holiday Mingle & Jingle at the Gettysburg Fire Department. This event was a great chance to meet with the local business community and thank them for the incredible work they do to support family-sustaining jobs in our district. Thank you to Carrie Stuart for hosting such a great event. The House Republicans' Commitment to America is centered on building an economy that's strong and that supports our local businesses. From solving staffing shortages to addressing the supply chain crisis that has affected everything from retail stores to manufacturing businesses, we are committed to getting our economy back on track. Our hearts are heavy as we mourn the death of Mapleton Firefighter Kurt Keilhofer. Kurt gave his life in service to our community, responding to a 911 call on December 6, 2022. Please join Alice and me as we pray for his family, loved ones, and the entire Mapleton community.

457," Friends, I am pleased to report that my bill, the Prevent Exposure to Narcotics and Toxins (PREVENT) Act, will soon be signed into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2023, which passed the Senate on Thursday. The crisis at our southern border has exploded to unprecedented levels, and with it we've seen a shocking rise in the amount of fentanyl flowing into the United States. Congress has a duty to ensure that every Customs and Border Patrol agent has the tools and protection they need to do their job safely and come home to their families. That's why my bipartisan bill ensures that border patrol agents can effectively interact with suspects trafficking fentanyl without having to fear lethal secondary exposure. Specifically, it will provide drug containment devices to border patrol agents and fund training on their proper use. These devices provide another layer of protection for agents beyond PPE by reducing possible exposure to fentanyl by creating a controlled environment. They also help better preserve chemical substances for later forensic analysis, improving the success of investigations. Border crossings remain at an all time high with more than 73,000 illegal immigrants evading Border Patrol agents in November alone. Additionally, Border Patrol officials seized more than 7,000 pounds of fentanyl in Fiscal Year 2022. That's not to mention that next week, Title 42 is expected to expire and up to 14,000 illegal immigrants are expected to cross our southern border every single day until the Administration secures the border. For comparison, that is more than half the population of an average congressional district illegally entering our country every month. It is critical that those working to defend and maintain our borders can do their jobs as safely as possible. Rest assured, as the crisis at our border escalates, I will continue to advocate for those working tirelessly to keep our borders secure. Protecting and Preserving the Great Lakes As someone who has long fought to protect and preserve the Great Lakes here in Congress, I'm proud that two of my Great Lakes bills will also soon be signed into law: the Aquatic Invasive Species Control Act and the Lake Erie Water Quality Protection Act. The Aquatic Invasive Species Control Act ensures that Ohio can better control, manage, and inspect invasive aquatic plants that threaten Lake Erie's fish and wildlife. Specifically, it amends existing control of aquatic plant growths and invasive species law by extending the authorization from Fiscal Year 2024 to Fiscal Year 2028 and increases the authorized invasive species partnerships funding level by $25 million. Additionally, it adds hydrilla to the list of prioritized control or eradication projects and explicitly includes the Lake Erie Basin and Ohio River Basin as listed areas under the invasive species partnerships section. The Lake Erie Water Quality Protection Act ensures dredging continues to support our regional economy and northeast Ohio's environmental sustainability. Specifically, it directs the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to prioritize the development of dredge material management plans (DMMPs) for Ohio's eight federal commercial navigation harbors along Lake Erie that adhere to the State's water quality laws. I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure irreplaceable natural resources like the Great Lakes are protected. Recognizing 386 Years of Our National Guard In closing, I want to recognize and celebrate 386 years of our National Guard. The National Guard is the oldest armed service in the United States. It even predates the American Revolution, tracing its lineage back to the legislation organizing the Massachusetts Bay Colony Militia, which was approved on December 13, 1636. The US military has always attracted our bravest and brightest, and the men and women of the National Guard are no exception. Thank you to all of our servicemembers who allow us to live safely and freely in the greatest country in the world. As a longtime supporter of ensuring America's military readiness, I will never stop fighting for the brave men and women who make endless sacrifices to protect our great nation.

458," New Legislation to Help West Virginians Introduced Dear Friend, This week I re-introduced The Working Families Childcare Access Act, which my dear friend Congresswoman Jackie Walorski introduced earlier last year, who tragically passed away in 2022. This bipartisan legislation is a reflection of Jackie's leadership and will aid our working families to ensure they have the resources they need to raise their children. The bill will focus on allowing parents to contribute to an employer-sponsored dependent care flexible spending account (FSA) and will roll over unused funds at the end of the year. Currently, these tax-advantaged accounts that allow certain additional expenses in dependent care such as sports, tutoring, music, or art are all limited to $5,000, and any funds not used by the end of the year are forfeited. The Working Families Childcare Access Act will support working families by increasing the annual contribution limit, eliminating the ""use-or-lose"" rule, expanding qualified expenses, and raising the age limit to ensure parents may save up for child care over a longer period of time. A bill that will provide the necessary support and resources our working families need. I also introduced the Emergency Taxpayer Paperwork and Audit Relief Act, alongside Senator Shelley Moore Capito, which will delay the implementation of the Democrat budget gimmick in the American Rescue Plan that lowers the threshold for Americans to receive a 1099-K form from the IRS for an additional year. Before the Democrats' law change, a taxpayer would have to earn at least $20,000 and have at least 200 transactions to qualify for a 1099-K form, now the Congressional Democrats expanded this by eliminating the 200 transaction requirement entirely and lowering the $20,000 hurdle to just $600 in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. I introduced the Saving Gig Economy Taxpayers Act in May of 2021 to restore the threshold to levels that were working just fine before Democrats complicated the system and gave taxpayers new headaches. This bill will allow the Republican-controlled House of Representatives more time to raise this threshold, fix this Democrat-created issue, and prevent 30 to 50 million new forms from being sent out next month. As always, do not hesitate to reach out to my office. I am here to help you and greatly value your input.

Website | About | Contact Me | Serving You | Media Center | Our District December 18, 2022 The Scalise Capitol Report With many in Louisiana picking up the pieces after this week's severe weather, my thoughts and prayers are with those impacted by the storms and tornadoes. I have been in touch with local officials on the ground and my office is ready to assist as the damage is assessed and we rebuild. Ending Biden's Harmful Vaccine Mandate for Our Military Recently, I joined Fox News Channel's Fox & Friends to emphasize the need to reverse the Biden Administration's harmful vaccine mandate on U.S. service members. Vaccine mandates have been a problem for a while in our military. We've seen recruitment down dramatically - over 25 percent or higher recruiting drop - because people don't want to get the mandated vaccine. It's not helping in terms of what we need to do to focus on China, the real threats around the world, and it's really posing long term threats to our military. Republicans pushed to end this mandate in the National Defense Authorization Act which passed the House and Senate recently. Click here or on the image above to view Whip Scalise's interview. Fighting for Louisiana Hurricane and Flood Protections Recently, the House passed the Water Resources Development Act of 2022 (WRDA) as a part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (NDAA). I am happy to see many of the priorities I fought for included in the final bill. Importantly, language I negotiated to authorize critical maintenance for the levee system protecting the Greater New Orleans area and additional hurricane protection for Grand Isle got included in the bill, providing for the continued safety of families and businesses. This bill will better prepare our communities for future storms and protect the lives and livelihoods of families and communities throughout Southeast Louisiana. Republicans have a Plan to Lower Energy Costs Recently, I penned an op-ed with my colleague Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne for the Houston Chronicle highlighting how the Biden Administration's extreme climate policies and war on American energy have raised the price of gasoline and electricity, making it more expensive for the average American to fuel their car and heat and cool their home. In the op-ed, we slammed President Biden for traveling to Saudi Arabia to beg OPEC countries for oil, only to have OPEC and its allies reduce oil production by two million barrels per day while House Republicans' "" Commitment to America "" agenda will bring back American energy independence and lower energy prices.

ANDREW IN THE NEWS Morning Cybersecurity: GOP trio wants DHS to buck up on oversight "" In a letter out this morning, three House Republicans are urging the Department of Homeland Security to complete a long-delayed report examining whether CISA boasts the personnel and resources it needs to meet its growing responsibilities. ""Understanding CISA's current ability to fulfill its mission and receiving a comprehensive review of the personnel and resources required to do so are absolutely paramount for congressional oversight and the security of our nation,"" write Reps. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) and John Katko (R-N.Y.) in the Friday missive. One year late - Addressed to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the letter criticizes the agency for failing to meet a January deadline for the review, suggesting it is not properly prioritizing its oversight of CISA. ""As the department overseeing CISA, submitting a baseline understanding of the ability of the agency to fulfill 'the missions of the agency' and a 'comprehensive force structure assessment of CISA' should be one of your highest priorities,"" reads the letter.

In three short days, Title 42 will expire. This is the emergency immigration policy that allows border patrol agents to swiftly remove illegal crossers from the country. In otherwards, it is the only thing standing between our already overcrowded southern border and a full-blown breakdown of our immigration system. No one is prepared for this rule to go away. Except, of course, for the people trying to exploit its absence. Oh, and they're already lining up! Take a look for yourself: Imagine if you were a border patrol agent right now. You're already facing the highest border crossing numbers ever, you're being run by an administration that directly undermines you, you're not allowed to use the remain in Mexico policy despite the Supreme Court's approval, and you're about to lose the number one tool you have at your disposal - Title 42. Frankly, I don't know how these brave men and women do it. They are on the front lines of protecting our homes, families, and communities from illegal drugs, criminals, and the Mexican cartel's human smuggling operations. They see children being used as pawns and mothers with wristbands indicating that they've paid the cartel to cross. I don't mean to sound hyperbolic here, but it's just the truth. When I visited the southern border back in June, the border patrol agents pleaded with us to do everything we can to keep Title 42 in place. One man described it like standing in front of a fire hydrant; Biden is about to turn the pressure way up. A nation without borders is not a nation, and I do not trust the Biden Administration to protect ours. Pray for our border patrol agents; they need a Christmas miracle. buddy's briefing In this week's edition of Buddy's Briefing , we're coming to you from the Library of Congress, a welcome respite from the insanity we witnessed on the House Floor this week. from our nation's capitol CCCLXXXIX Monday, December 12, 2022 : Before heading to the airport for my return trip to Washington this morning, I have a radio interview with John Fredericks as we discuss news of the day, including our Republican leadership race and oversight hearings that we plan to have next session when we are in the majority. Once back in my office, I join in on our all staff conference call where we discuss this week's upcoming agenda. As this is the last scheduled week for us to be session in Washington, there are many holiday get-togethers as well as retirement parties for those members not returning next session. After attending a few of those, I head to our weekly Whip Team meeting before heading to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the week.

Next, I head to a meeting of the Georgia congressional delegation to discuss committee assignments for the next Congress. Once back in my office, I meet with representatives from Americans for Prosperity before meeting with a Georgia and Liberian Trade delegation led by Vernell Cutter. Next, I meet with the Korean Vice Foreign Minister, Mr. Lee Do Hoon, and other members of his delegation to discuss the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and its negative impact on Korean trade.

Mike Rogers (R-AL) Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee. After a meeting off Capitol Hill with members of the Medical Association of Georgia (MAG), I head back to the Capitol where I host the MAG members on a night tour of the Capitol. Wednesday, December 14, 2022 : After our all staff conference call, I head to the Senate for the dedication ceremony of the naming of the Veteran Affairs Atlanta Regional Office in honor of the late Senator Johnny Isakson. This is a great tribute to this great Georgian to commemorate his work and legacy fighting for Georgia's veterans. Afterwards, I head back to the House side of the Capitol and to the Rayburn building for the 117th Congress Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee portrait followed by an E&C full committee markup. Next, I head to the House Chamber where I pay tribute to Tierra Jackson , a student at the UGA College of Pharmacy who has recently been selected as President of the Student National Pharmaceutical Association (SNPhA) and Natalie Navarrette , a student at UGA who has recently been awarded a Rhodes Scholarship. After heading to a meeting of the conservative Republican Study Committee (RSC), I head back to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the day and then return to my office where I meet with Lucid Hearing to discuss the implementation of over-the-counter sales of hearing aids, a result of legislation that I passed a few years ago.

Next, I head to the Senate where, along with Sen. Chris Van Holland (D-MD), Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Rep. John Garamendi (D-CA), I meet with the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed, to discuss the civil unrest his country is currently experiencing. Afterwards, I head back to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the day and then head back to my office before heading to the Library of Congress where I film this week's edition of Buddy's Briefing . Next, I head back to the House Chamber for our final vote series of the week and then head back to my office where I meet with the Interim CEO of the American Pharmacist Association (APhA), Dr. Ilisa Bernstein. Because of inclement weather, my flights have been delayed and I spend the afternoon working in my office before flying back home later in the evening. Friday, December 16, 2022 : After getting back late last night, my first meeting this morning is at the Savannah Convention Center on Hutchinson Island where I meet with Authority board Chair Mark Smith and others for an update on their expansion project. After a very informative meeting, I head to JCB in Pooler where I meet with North America CEO Richard Fox-Marrs and his leadership team to discuss the challenges all major manufacturers are experiencing these days. I also have an opportunity to speak with members of the work team to update them on happenings in Washington. Afterwards, I head to EmployAbility in Savannah where I meet with CEO/President Brendan Ferrara who shares with me their mission of preparing adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities for competitive employment and community integration. Later in the evening, I head to the National Museum of the Mighty Eight Air Force in Pooler where I am honored to bring greetings to the Filipino American Association of Coastal Georgia at their Christmas Gala.

As Christmas fast approaches, I hope your season is filled with holiday cheer and plenty of family time. The Forgotten American Prisoner Last week, it was unbelievable to watch President Biden's prisoner swap celebration while Pittsburgh teacher Marc Fogel remains locked up in Russia. In his remarks, Biden failed even to mention Fogel's name . Congress must investigate the negotiation process that brought Griner home but left Fogel and former Marine Paul Whelan in Russia. Electing to trade only a celebrity basketball player for a notorious Russian international arms dealer - while Fogel and Whelan remain in Russia - warrants heavy scrutiny. I'll get to the bottom of this disaster and stop at nothing to bring Fogel and Whelan home. Honoring our Purple Heart Recipients The Purple Heart medal is our nation's oldest military award and recognizes the sacrifices of service members who suffered combat wounds and death. In this year's National Defense Authorization Act , I am proud to have secured language to require each military service branch to ensure that a publicly available website includes a link to a description of the background of the Purple Heart, the eligibility criteria for awarding the Purple Heart, and contact information for each service's awards and decorations branch. This legislation is critical to honor the service and sacrifice of Purple Heart recipients and assist veterans service organizations attempting to identify individuals most in need of their resources. Supporting Mission-Readiness for the Air National Guard For nearly 75 years, the 171st Air Refueling Wing from southwestern PA helped to protect the United States and its allies in the skies - including being one of the first units activated after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Last week, the House of Representatives passed the National Defense Authorization Act , which included my bipartisan language to support the top-notch capabilities of the Air National Guard's refueling mission. Air Guardsmen from across our nation, including the 171st Air Refueling Wing, play a critical role in meeting national objectives, enhancing global reach and power, and supporting ongoing operations. As a Navy veteran, I will always support the men and women who sacrifice everything for our nation.

465," News from Congressman Andy Biggs Home About The District News Contact The Week in Review I hope everyone has had a great week. Read below to see what I've been working on! THIS TUESDAY: Taxpayer Advocate Service Event in Gilbert This Tuesday, I will be bringing in representatives from the Taxpayer Advocate Service to provide on-site assistance for constituents in the Fifth Congressional District. They will ensure that every taxpayer is treated fairly and understands their rights. They will help you if you have unresolved tax problems. Hope to see you there! When: Tuesday, December 20, from 1 to 5 pm AZ Time Where: Southeast Regional Library (Study Room 1 and 2) 775 N Greenfield Rd Gilbert, AZ 85234 What: On-site assistance from the Taxpayer Advocate Service to help with tax problems that you can't resolve on your own. Impeaching Secretary Mayorkas Press Conference On Tuesday, I led a press conference regarding the impeachment of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in the 118th Congress. I was the first member of Congress to introduce articles of impeachment against Secretary Mayorkas, introducing them in August 2021 after concluding that Secretary Mayorkas' dereliction of duty in protecting our nation's borders constituted high crimes and misdemeanors. I expect the House Judiciary Committee to open an impeachment inquiry in the 118th Congress, conduct a formal investigation, and finally proceed to impeach him. Nearly 20 members of Congress and former Trump Administration immigration officials provided remarks and advocated for the impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas. Click below to watch a recap of the press conference. Insert screenshot of CSPAN link. The GOP Requires a Stronger House Speaker This week, The Washington Examiner published my latest opinion editorial on why the Republican Party requires a stronger House speaker. My disagreements with Kevin McCarthy are rooted in my desire for a stronger, better Republican Party, one that prioritizes the needs of our voters, resists the pull of establishment influences, and is unified in both its ideological and political goals. That's the kind of party that can set this nation back on the right track. McCarthy doesn't have the 218 votes needed to become the next Speaker of the House and he will never get them. It's time to change the status quo. The piece may be read here . New Legislation to Lower Energy Prices On Wednesday, I introduced the Federal Land Freedom Act. This legislation would empower states to control the development and production of all forms of energy on all available federal land within their state boundaries. It would also cut red tape that hinders a state's ability to develop energy resources on federal land. The Biden Administration has launched a war on American energy so states must take matters into their own hands. My legislation would help states increase energy production by eliminating overbearing bureaucratic red tape and expanding available land for energy production. America offers robust energy resources. They must be used to help curb inflation and make the nation energy independent again. For years, Senator Inhofe has championed this bill in the Senate. His leadership on energy issues will be missed in the new Congress. I'm grateful for the opportunity to lead this important legislation in the House of Representatives. Co-sponsors include: Western Caucus Chairman Dan Newhouse (R-WA), Representative Chris Stewart (R-UT), Representative Stephanie Bice (R-OK), and Representative Paul A. Gosar DDS (R-AZ). The legislation may be read here . The Washington Times covered my legislation here . Combating Myths from ""The Evolution of Anti-Democratic Extremist Groups and the Ongoing Threat to Democracy"" Hearing On Wednesday, the House Oversight and Reform Committee held a hearing titled ""The Evolution of Anti-Democratic Extremist Groups and the Ongoing Threat to Democracy."" I spoke about the necessity to combat evil on both sides of the political spectrum, but Democrats continue to only smear Republicans as extremists and threats to Democracy. Payton Gendron, the individual who committed a mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, this past June was a well-documented socialist and eco-fascist. He repeatedly attacked Rupert Murdoch of Fox News and the Daily Wire's Ben Shapiro with pejorative terms. Similarly, the Paul Pelosi attacker, David Dupape, was a radical leftist who experts believe committed the attack as a 'result' of Republican rhetoric and 'MAGA terrorism.' We have to address evil when evil occurs. We cannot point fingers at just one side. Click the image below to see some of my remarks from the hearing. Protecting Our Second Amendment Rights Yesterday, I served as the Ranking Member in the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security hearing titled The Search for Bipartisan Solutions to Gun Violence. Despite the title of the hearing, there hasn't been an honest engagement and search for bipartisan solutions to gun violence. This is mostly because there's only one solution for my friends across the aisle and that is to emasculate the Second Amendment and remove guns from legal, lawful, and law abiding citizens. My colleagues across the aisle would like to ignore the connection between adolescent males growing up without their fathers and these violent events. And yet, studies indicate very clearly there is a significant correlation and probably a causative effect. It's important to look at root causes for this violence and not focus solely on taking away Second Amendment constitutionally protected rights. Click the image below to see some of my remarks. Letters and Legislation Bills Sponsored HR. 9535 - Federal Land Freedom Act Bills Cosponsored . 102 - Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Veterans Affairs relating to ""Reproductive Health Services"" . My America First Contract House Republicans will need to immediately reverse the Democrats' disastrous policies to get our country back in good shape come January. My America First Contract is an outline to reduce inflation and strengthen the economy, secure our border, restore transparency and parental choice in education, reduce violent crime and preserve the rule of law, restore election integrity, break up Big Tech, put America First in foreign, energy, and trade policies, and reinstate good government practices. In addition to achieving these eight goals, the plan calls on conducting enhanced oversight and using available leverages to stop the abuse of power from President Biden in 2023. I will introduce legislation supporting each area of the plan within the first 100 days of the next Congressional term and will work with my colleagues to bring that legislation up for consideration in the House. The full contract may be read here . Alien Invasion Border Documentary I recently released my new border documentary titled Alien Invasion . The 30-minute documentary features footage from private ranches along the border, the Darien Gap in Panama, and interviews with members of Congress, Border Patrol, local and state law enforcement, and much more. It addresses how President Biden's border crisis began, its consequences, and solutions to address the crisis. The border documentary may be watched here .

Lesko Receives Briefing on Southern Border I joined my Congressional colleagues to receive a briefing from the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General and discuss the ongoing border crisis. With Title 42 set to end in just a few days, it is more important than ever to secure our southern border. Lesko Meets with Quaise Energy I also met with Quaise Energy and discussed their new technology that can drill through unprecedented depths of rock to access the hot temperatures needed to harness the power of geothermal energy!

Thanks to the tireless efforts of his parents, the Brandon Act became law to honor Brandon's legacy and help service members quickly seek mental health care. Watch my full remarks below: Lesko Stands Up Against Big Tech Censorship With the release of the Twitter Files, we now know that Twitter was colluding with the federal government and Democrats to censor conservatives and silence free speech. I joined my Republican colleagues on the House Energy and Commerce Committee in fighting to hold the Biden Administration accountable for colluding with Big Tech companies to censor the story about Hunter Biden's laptop and silence conservatives. Watch my full remarks below: GET THE FACTS: President Biden's Cost of Living Crisis Continues The Consumer Price Index, a key inflation index, rose at an annual rate of 7.1% in November 2022, demonstrating that Americans are still suffering under high inflation because of Biden and House Democrats' out-of-control spending to fuel their radical agenda. The high inflation rate has caused real average hourly earnings to decrease by 1.9% over the past year . The skyrocketing cost of goods and services will cost the average American household over $700 per month , which adds up to over $8,000 per year . President Biden's cost of living crisis has hit Arizonans even harder. The rising costs are costing the average Arizona household nearly $900 per month and over $10,000 per year. In the new majority, House Republicans are committed to creating an economy that's strong. We will fight this crisis and work to lower the cost of living for Arizonans and families across America.

467," Jan's Plans & Pans - December 17, 2022 Dear    , This week, I was excited to begin welcoming guests to my new office in the Rayburn House Office Building. Now, I have a magnificent view of the United States Capitol. I am so appreciative to my staff who worked so hard to make this move happen. If you are ever in Washington, please come by and check out my wonderful new space! We are now approaching the end of the 117th Congress. This is a very important time because we are making the final push to pass crucial legislation before the 118th Congress begins on January 3rd. This week, the House and Senate passed a one-week continuing resolution to keep the government funded through December 23rd and to avoid a shutdown. I will return to Washington next week to vote on a larger appropriations package that will fund the government through the new fiscal year. In this package, we are also hoping to include the Electoral Count Act, which says the Vice President does not have the power to overturn the vote of the Electoral College, additional funding for Ukraine, and more relief funds for areas in the United States impacted by natural disasters. I am still pushing to include my privacy bill, which will protect consumer data online, and my INFORM Consumers Act, which will prevent the sale of counterfeit products on online marketplaces. Everyone deserves to feel safe online. The United States has a duty to lead in advancing progress toward a future with less gender-based violence and greater equality around the world. On Monday, I was proud to introduce the International Violence Against Women Act, alongside U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and U.S. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), which would guarantee we have a Gender-Based Violence Strategy that puts victims and survivors first. By integrating the work of the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development, this bill would make the eradication of violence against women a central piece of the U.S. foreign policy agenda and ensure that gender-based violence prevention and response are included in all our humanitarian efforts around the globe. Women and girls around the globe need our assistance, and with this legislation, we can deliver. As it stands right now, Illinois has more lead service lines than any other state in the U.S. There are approximately 700,000 lead service lines in Illinois. Exposure to lead can cause a variety of health problems, including child developmental delays and nervous system damage. Thanks to President Biden's Infrastructure Law, $15 billion is being spent nationwide on lead pipe removal. Just last week, the city of Evanston received $1 million from the state of Illinois capital funds to assist the city in replacing lead service lines in south Evanston. We must replace all lead service lines and ensure that our drinking water is safe. If you need any assistance from a federal agency, whether it be a Social Security problem, an immigration case, or a postal issue, just to name a few, my office is here to help. Head to my website for further assistance and information. To everyone celebrating, Happy Hanukkah! Wishing you prosperity, love, and laughter. Sincerely, Free COVID-19 Tests Available Thanks to the Biden administration, you can now get four more free Covid-19 at-home test kits delivered to your door. You can order online via the federally run website . Orders will be mailed by USPS, starting this week. To receive the kits, you only need to provide a U.S. residential address when ordering. You can register your email address for delivery updates, but that is optional.

469," A message from Senator Michael Bennet Hello everyone, Over the last decade, I've heard from farmers and ranchers across Colorado that they don't have enough workers. The reason for that is clear - since 2012, the cost of farm labor has gone up nearly 50%, driving family farmers out of business. At the same time, we have hundreds of thousands of undocumented workers contributing every single day to feeding America but living in the shadows. This week, I brought together bipartisan members of Congress, farmworkers, and agricultural leaders around a targeted, common-sense proposal to address the labor crisis in American agriculture and to save family farms in this country: my Affordable and Secure Food Act. Watch me talk about this bill HERE . Just in the past year, the farm labor crisis has contributed to driving up grocery prices by almost 12%. My bill addresses this by increasing the number of farmworker visas, creating wage certainty for farmers, and forging a pathway to legal status for undocumented workers who've helped feed America for at least ten years. This plan is broadly supported by farmers, labor and immigration advocates, and small businesses. To fulfill our duty to the American people, to the rural economy, and to agriculture, Congress needs to get this done. Sincerely, Michael RECOGNIZING DENVER'S SUCCESS DELIVERING CLEAN WATER TO ALL No parent in America should worry about the water their kids drink. However, there are millions of families across the country for whom replacing their lead pipes is too expensive. That's why I introduced my Financing Lead Out of Water (FLOW) Act - to reduce the financial burden that homeowners face to extend safe drinking water to every household. My bill is based on the example of Denver Water, which has set the standard for water providers working with homeowners to replace harmful lead pipes. Last week, I joined them to learn more about the $76 million they have received from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to meet their commitment to replace every customer-owned lead pipe and prioritize underserved neighborhoods. CELEBRATING EQUALITY AT THE WHITE HOUSE Last week, I spoke on the floor of the Senate to honor the victims and survivors of the Club Q tragedy and to urge my colleagues to pass the Respect for Marriage Act. On Tuesday, I joined President Joe Biden at the White House for the signing of this bipartisan bill recognizing same-sex marriage at the federal level and taking a step toward equality for LGBTQ people across the country. Coloradans understand there is no right closer to the heart than marrying the one that you love. HONORING PIONEERS OF WOMEN'S SUFFRAGE This week, I joined my colleagues in introducing a bill to install a national monument to women's suffrage on the National Mall. This effort started a few years back, when a group of Coloradans from Loveland began a community-led effort to install a sculpture commemorating the pioneers of the women's suffrage movement in Washington, D.C. Their effort required an act of Congress, and in 2020, we passed bipartisan legislation to establish the monument. After a robust process to pick a site for the monument, those involved in the effort chose the National Mall. The National Mall has been the site of historic calls for progress for generations. This monument to our nation's long journey toward equality deserves this most dignified location in both our nation's capital and our nation's history.

470," December 17, 2022 Dear Fellow Utahn, It was a productive week in Washington as I proudly supported final House passage of the National Defense Authorization Act and my LODGE Act unanimously passed the House Natural Resources Committee. It's been a big year for Team Moore, and we are grateful for all the ways you have engaged with us! My team and I have worked hard on reversing our debt culture in Washington, supporting Hill Air Force Base , hosting town halls, and getting bills signed into law--and we will bring these priorities into the next Congress. We wish you and your family a wonderful Christmas season and a very happy New Year! Click here to watch my end of year remarks. Passing the National Defense Authorization Act I was thrilled to vote for the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act. This bipartisan bill is the culmination of the hard work of my team, colleagues, and the Armed Services Committee as we continue the tradition of overcoming partisan divides to put forth a bill that supports military members & their families. My team and I successfully pushed for provisions in this package that support Hill Air Force Base and Utah's defense community, including depot modernization, Utah Test and Training Range improvements, better housing for airmen, full funding for the Sentinel program, and more. To read my full statement, click here . Increasing Affordable Housing with the LODGE Act My Lodging Options Developed for Government Employees (LODGE) Act , introduced with Congressman Jimmy Panetta (D-CA), passed the House Natural Resources Committee by unanimous consent! This bill will bring relief to the housing markets for National Park Service employees around our gateway communities and provide NPS employees better living and working conditions so they can focus on maintaining our national parks for generations to come. Read more about the LODGE Act here . Honoring Technical Sergeant Burton Patrick Juengel I spent a somber morning with the Utah Air National Guard's 151 st Wing to honor the life and support the family of Tech. Sgt. Burton Patrick Juengel, who passed away in the line of duty the week of Thanksgiving. The brave airmen of the 151 st continue to fuel efforts to fly, fight, and win by providing refueling missions that keep our plans airborne. Tech. Sgt. Juengel was a hard worker and valued member of his team. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Kaylee. Connecting with First District Mayors On Thursday, I jumped on a call with 20+ First District mayors to provide an update on my legislative work and priorities for my next term in Washington. These mayors have worked tirelessly on behalf of their communities, and I've appreciated our opportunities of collaboration this year. Close Up in DC It was great to meet with the Recursion team on Friday and tour their facilities. Recursion is a Salt Lake City-based biotechnology company that's developing novel therapeutics through biology, chemistry, and technology. Temple Lighting Ceremony with Elder Cook Team Moore had a great time volunteering at the Ogden Christmas Village and helping with the Breakfast Exchange Club 's Shoes for Tots truck!

Thanks to the Biden administration and the radical left's failed policy agenda, many will struggle this Christmas and holiday season. In Congress, I've been focused on reversing this harmful trend. I've voted against legislation that has aggravated inflation, like the majority's misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, which only increased the federal deficit. I introduced an alternative, the Inflation Prevention Act , which would give Congress a tool to cap federal spending during periods of inflation higher than a rate of 4.5%. I've also called on Governor Newsom to suspend the gas tax , another measure to fight inflation and make life more affordable for families in our district. In the new House majority, I will remain focused on stopping the far left's reckless spending. Americans have been suffering far too long and the government must be held accountable. FAREWELL SIMI VALLEY & WELCOME GRANADA HILLS In a few short weeks, I will unfortunately no longer have the privilege of representing the beautiful Simi Valley in Congress. During last year's redistricting process, the district that I represent was redrawn to only include northern Los Angeles County, from Granada Hills to the Antelope Valley. While I am saddened by no longer representing Simi Valley, I look forward to serving my new constituents in Granada Hills, and continuing to serve the Santa Clarita Valley and Antelope Valley. It was the pleasure of a lifetime to be able to serve the community of Simi Valley. Thank you. SPEAKING WITH UCLA STUDENTS IN D.C. I welcomed a cohort of UCLA students to our nation's capital to discuss leadership and my role as a member of Congress. We discussed my background, current issues facing our nation, and I answered several questions from the students. Enjoyed talking with these students! PSA: NEW D.C.

Supporting Our Troops During the Holidays America is the land of the free and home of the brave because of the courageous members of our Armed Forces who dedicate their lives to serving our country. In America, our servicemembers protect our homeland by standing in defense our nation's ideals all over the globe. Volunteering to serve our country is heroic, especially because members of the military say goodbye to their loved ones for extended periods of time, including the holidays, throughout deployments. We owe all members of the Armed Forces and veterans our gratitude for their sacrifices, especially during the holiday season and Christmastime. This week, it was my honor to join the American Red Cross at their Holiday Mail for Heroes event where I, and other Members of Congress, wrote cards to servicemembers protecting our country overseas. The holiday season marks a particularly important time to highlight our appreciation for the selfless sacrifices of our solders to protect America and its principles all around the world. Community Events? An essential duty of mine as your Representative is to visit different areas in the Sixth District to talk to folks like you about the day's most important issues. I enjoy hearing your feedback and speaking with all residents of the Sixth District about the most pressing issues facing our communities.

Democrats have made it clear they would rather continue with radical government spending than work to reverse the problems their failed policies have created. Another reckless spending bill isn't the right answer. REFLECTING ON THE PAST TEN YEARS The end of each year allows us to reflect on what is behind us and look forward to what is to come. As we begin this new chapter, thank you for putting your trust in me. It's a responsibility I will never take lightly. Ten years ago, Christie and I were fed up with the Washington bureaucracy telling us how to run our business. The burdensome regulation made it nearly impossible for us to do our job. This kid from Westville had no political experience but ran for Congress anyways, promising to fight for Oklahoma. We never could have imagined what the Lord would have in store. It has been the honor of a lifetime to represent the Second District, the place where I was raised and have now raised our family, and to fight for the Oklahoma values we hold dear. Using the Constitution as my guide, I hope I have made you proud in keeping our God-given rights at the forefront of all I do. My appreciation for our law enforcement officers, servicemembers, and veterans is unwavering, and I'm grateful to have been given a voice for all of us in Oklahoma. I'll always look back on my time on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) with pride. The Energy and Commerce Committee has broad jurisdiction over many government aspects directly related to the everyday lives of Oklahomans, including health care, energy production, and consumer safety. It was here we could fight for our domestic producers and push back again the Left's radical climate agenda, an issue deeply personal to our state. Further, being tapped for HPSCI was nothing short of an honor, as was the opportunity to witness the dedication of our Intelligence Community firsthand. Oklahomans have watched our family grow and prayed alongside us as it happened. At the start of this journey, Christie and I were parents to three kids. Through the blessing of adoption, we doubled that number to six, welcoming our twin girls and our son, Jayce. I wouldn't be here today without the support of my family. Christie is our rock, and I thank God for her every day. I made a promise no one will outwork me. I quickly learned the only exception to that notion is my staff. My office has returned millions of dollars to constituents from state and federal agencies, taken on the IRS, and ensured our veterans receive the benefits they have earned. One hundred bills were introduced, over one thousand bills were cosponsored, and countless committee markups took place. It's a team effort, and I'm glad to surround myself with those whose dedication to our great state is the same. Any undertaking, whether it's a sport or career, growing a business, or starting a new one, is always accompanied by personal growth. For those who ask, the biggest lesson I've learned is how to take a deep breath and quit taking things personally. In this time of reflection, I began saying, ""love the people, love the call."" I refuse to give up the fight for what is best for Oklahoma and our democracy and look forward to continuing that work in the new year. ALWAYS READY, ALWAYS THERE Happy birthday, U.S. National Guard! Thank you for 386 years of courageous service. BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS TO RURAL HEALTH ACCESS Many Rural Americans have trouble accessing the quality health services they deserve. On Friday, I joined U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (OH) and Susan Collins (ME) and U.S. Representatives Jason Smith (MO-08), Judy Chu (CA-24), and Jan Schakowsky (IL-9) in introducing the Increasing Mental Health Options Act of 2022. This bill will remove unnecessary barriers that have kept psychologists, who are well-equipped to provide mental health care, from delivering care to seniors under Medicare. It will also modernize Medicare statutes to ensure independent practices, like the ones in my district, are covered. WORKING IN WASHINGTON Thank you to everyone who took their time to meet with me this week. It was great to connect with H.E. Murat Mercan, the Ambassador of Turkiye. We discussed the importance of transatlantic partnerships between the United States and the Republic of Turkiye. It was an honor to receive the Americans for Prosperity's first-ever ""Pioneers for Prosperity"" award for the 117th Congress. WEEKLY WRAP UP Mr. President, what is more important than our national security? There have been over four million migrant encounters at our southern border since February 2021.

After the Dobbs decision, it became clear that some of the hard-fought rights we thought were safe might now be in jeopardy. Now, by signing the Respect for Marriage Act, we have ensured that marriage equality cannot be rolled back by the courts. It's a historic milestone for our country, but also an important, personal moment for me, as I was able to attend the signing of the bill with my late mom's longtime partner, Anne. My mom came out in suburban Detroit in the 1980s and lived the rest of her life as a gay woman - certainly not an easy thing to do at the time. She passed away before her and Anne could marry, but I know how proud she would be of the monumental step we have taken - Rep. Elissa Slotkin P.S.

477," Introducing The Apprenticeship Freedom Act Apprenticeships play a vital role in developing the American workforce. Right now, President Biden's Department of Labor dictates how Americans can run these valuable programs. By striking the current requirement under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to register apprenticeships with the Department of Labor, we can restore control of American businesses to employers and curb the power of Washington bureaucrats. There are 27,000 apprenticeship programs registered with the Department of Labor, with Virginia boasting the highest active number at 2,845. Currently, 83% of apprenticeship programs in America are run by business owners. This only makes sense because American employers, not Washington bureaucrats, know what is best for their businesses, including how to develop the skills their workforce needs to be successful. I introduced the Apprenticeship Freedom Act to increase opportunities for employers seeking to contribute to the workforce. By giving businesses the flexibility to utilize these programs and develop skilled employees, the workforce as a whole will be strengthened. My common-sense legislation would allow employers more say in how they run their own apprenticeship programs and still remain eligible for funding, rather than being forced to comply with more government regulations. Fighting for Conservative Policies in Washington I was honored to be one of the first members to receive Americans for Prosperity's Pioneer for Prosperity Award, given to members of Congress who are champions for conservative policies. It was wonderful to meet with AFP's Lauren Stewart and CJ Sailor. Thank you, AFP! Securing Biden's Open Border The Biden Administration's incompetent policies have led to a massive invasion at our southern border. I have long been on record saying that we must remove Secretary Mayorkas from office. He has aided directly in the facilitation of this crisis which is harming ALL Americans. I was proud to stand alongside Reps. Andy Biggs (AZ-05) and Brian Babin (TX-36) and my fellow Republican colleagues at a recent press conference expressing the need to impeach Secretary Mayorkas in the new Congress. Ending Wasteful Government Programs AmeriCorps is impractical, unconstitutional, and a waste of hardworking American taxpayer dollars; and it must be eliminated. During the Education and Labor subcommittee hearing, I questioned Ms. Deborah Jeffrey and Mr. Michael Smith of the Corporation for National and Community Services about AmeriCorps's failure to track its grant funds and keep sex offenders from entering our workforce. In the 5th District I attended the ribbon cutting ceremony for Virginia MetalFab with Governor Glenn Youngkin to celebrate the creation of 130 new jobs in Appomattox. This expansion will bolster Virginia's economy and prove once again that the 5th District is a great place to do business. In the News In January, the House will be the only thing standing between Americans and the Democrats' assault on freedom, the family, the economy, and our national security.

478," Congresswoman Tenney's Weekly Newsletter Have questions? Contact Me Here Leading the Charge to Hold NY Attorney General Letitia James Accountable This week, I sent a letter to New York Governor Kathy Hochul calling on her to appoint a special counsel to investigate allegations of sexual harassment within New York Attorney General Letitia James' office. Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and Congressman Chris Jacobs joined me in sending this letter. On December 2, 2022, the New York Times reported that Ms. James' longtime Chief of Staff, Ibrahim Khan, resigned due to at least two sexual harassment allegations against him. This comes after allegations leveled in 2017 that Mr. Khan had drugged and sexually assaulted a coworker at a December 2014 holiday party. This long track record of inappropriate and possibly criminal behavior over many years brings into question Ms. James' claim that she was not aware previously of Mr. Khan's conduct. It is also concerning that Ms. James hired a law firm, Littler Mendelson, to which she has a personal connection, to perform an audit on her office. In addition, unlike her investigation into disgraced former Governor Andrew Cuomo, Ms. James refused to vet the Littler Mendelson contract with Comptroller DiNapoli. Letitia James is the most partisan Attorney General in the nation, and she has lost the public's trust. Unfortunately for the people of New York, she is not above Albany Democrats' rampant culture of corruption, and instead she is proving to be just another part of it. To restore public trust in this important office, it is imperative that Governor Hochul immediately appoint an independent special counsel to probe the culture of sexual harassment in Attorney General James' office as well as her efforts over the years to conceal it from the public. Governor Hochul told New Yorkers she would put an end to Albany's culture of sexual harassment and corruption. If she truly means what she says, now would be an excellent opportunity for her to prove it to New Yorkers. Read my full letter here .

We also discussed ongoing efforts to combat global food insecurity, which also helps support the continued agricultural exports of New York's farmers. During this segment, I also discussed the bipartisan commitment to civility I first took as a member of Congress in 2017, when I was sworn in alongside Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi. I look forward to working with my colleagues to continue to promote constructive discourse and positive leadership for our Nation. Our country faces many challenges today, and it is critically important that Congress works together to find solutions that help seniors, working families and small businesses and family farms. I will always be a compassionate advocate for my community. Watch my full interview here or at the link above. I'm committed to restoring transparency to government, which is why I explain every vote I take on the House floor. While we may not always agree, you will always know where I stand on the issues and how I vote in Congress. This Congress my office has already explained more than 420 votes. One piece of legislation we considered this week, the Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act, impacts the great research and development happening in our own community. H.R. 7535 is a win for the Research Lab in Rome and our national security. To read more about my votes and see the full list with explanations of all the legisl ation considere d this week, please click here As I mentioned, I voted ""Yes"" on the Senate Amendment to H.R. 7535, the Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act. Although still in its developing stages, the creation of quantum computing has shown the potential to radically improve our computing capacity by reducing the computing time for some calculations from years to mere minutes or even seconds. A great deal of the research into this new technology is occurring right here in upstate New York at the Air Force Research Lab in Rome, New York. However, this increased capacity also brings the risk of allowing bad actors to easily override the algorithms and encryption methods that currently secure most of our digital data. This bill with help mitigate national security risks, requiring the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish a rule or binding guidance related to the migration of Executive Branch cryptographic systems to post-quantum cryptography. These are the types of necessary steps we must take to keep the data of Americans safe. This bill passed by a vote of 420-3.

480," As the holiday season kicks into high gear, it is natural to focus on the incredible displays of com ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ December 17, 2022 Dear Fellow Marylanders, As the holiday season kicks into high gear, it is natural to focus on the incredible displays of compassion and charity that we see across Maryland and nationwide. Clothing drives, food drives, toy drives and more keep up our faith that community members are looking out for each other. With this in mind, it is painful for me to see how hate crimes, particularly antisemitic incidents, are on the rise in this country - record highs, in fact. Last year, we recorded the highest number of antisemitic attacks in the United States ever, and 2022 appears to be on a similar trajectory. The numbers, a small snapshot of which were released earlier this year by the FBI as part of its annual hate crimes report , are cause for great concern. Twice last month, Marylanders woke up to discover antisemitic and racist graffiti - first on the Bethesda Trolley Trail and the next week at the College Park/University of Maryland Metro Station parking garage. Unfortunately, these were not the first such incidents. According to the Anti-Defamation League , which also tracks such activity nationwide, there has been an uptick in threats to threats to identifiably Jewish spaces, including synagogues, Jewish community centers, and Jewish day schools. The threat is so serious that on November 30, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a warning about the ""heightened"" potential for violent domestic attacks, including antisemitic attacks. In recent years, synagogues have been violently attacked in Colleyville, Texas , Pittsburgh, Pa ., and Poway, Calif . It's shameful that synagogues and other houses of worship need to have armed security guards because of the threats to people as they pray. More than 25% of Jews in America report feeling unsafe . Antisemitism is not a new phenomenon. What is new is the current wave of popular entertainers, professional athletes and public figures who are spreading antisemitic tropes to their followers on social media or through public statements. We all know that Donald Trump had dinner recently at Mar-a-Lago with "" Ye "" and self-described Holocaust denier and antisemite Nick Fuentes. Trump also had his photo taken with Liz Crokin, a prominent follower of QAnon , a group known for spreading antisemitic conspiracy theories. That a former president of the United States of America would give such hateful individuals a platform and spotlight is horrible. But this is not another email about Donald Trump and his latest embrace of hate for his own political purposes. Standing up against antisemitism and hate is about all of us. We must speak out loudly and clearly against antisemitism when it occurs. We cannot allow antisemitism - or any other type of prejudice or intolerance - to be normalized. But what about the First Amendment? Although the First Amendment protects even hateful speech, if that speech motivates someone to commit a crime, engage in violence, or take action that infringes on someone else's right, that speech is not protected under the First Amendment and there must be accountability. Antisemitism also brings with it additional threats. The conspiracy theories and disinformation targeted at Jews often use the age-old trope that claims ""Jews control everything"" to degrade public trust in government and the news media, and the rule of law. The twisted spread of antisemitism, disinformation, and conspiracy theories directly lead to hate crimes, crime of violence, and even insurrection, as seen in the violent January 6 th attack at the Capitol. Antisemitism is a danger to American society and to our national security. I appreciate that President Joe Biden has consistently spoken out against antisemitism and hate-based violence. He has encouraged ""a whole-of-society response to hate-fueled violence and to foster national unity."" The White House summit he convened September 15 was an important part of this mobilization . On November 29, I convened a working group in the U.S. Capitol with Senators Jacky Rosen and Richard Blumenthal, and Congressman Marc Veasy, as well as high-level officials from across the government and the non-profit sector who are actively engaged in countering antisemitism. We heard from very senior officials from across the government on their agencies' efforts to combat domestic and international antisemitism. Our dialogue was followed by a White House roundtable hosted by Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff with senior administration officials and leading civil society groups. This last week, I chaired a hearing of the U.S. Helsinki Commission on "" The Alarming Rise in Antisemitism and its Threat to Democracy ."" Witnesses included the State Department's Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt, and Rabbi Andrew Baker, Personal Representative of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office on Combating Antisemitism, and Director of International Jewish Affairs at the American Jewish Committee (AJC). Consistent coordination across our government and society is essential. As hate-based and antisemitic events occur, creating a timely, centralized space for agencies to share information with Congress, key stakeholders - and each other - will strengthen our response in the future. To that point, I am grateful that earlier this month, President Biden answered the call from Congress and others to develop a unified, national strategy to counter antisemitism. The president formally established an interagency group led by the Domestic Policy Council and National Security Council to ""increase and better coordinate U.S. government efforts to counter antisemitism, Islamophobia, and related forms of bias and discrimination within the United States."" Such a national strategy on countering antisemitism must be built on strengthening education, protecting public safety, improving law enforcement and data collection, coalition building with other groups and leadership. We also need public involvement. Countering antisemitism and other hate must be a public endeavor. There is an incredible amount of important work done behind the scenes, but if the public is not engaged in pushing back against antisemitism and hate, the haters will be emboldened. Please know that I will remain active in the ongoing fight against antisemitism and hate wherever it manifests. I would ask you to do the same. We can all play a part in ensuring that compassion, charity and love can carry on well beyond this holiday season. I thank you for your time. Sincerely, Ben Cardin Is this email forwarded to you?

481," Dear  , This week, the U.S. House and U.S. Senate voted to pass a short-term funding agreement and extend the deadline to pass an end-of-year funding package. Also this week - the President signed into law historic protections for same-sex and interracial couples! Please keep reading for information about new legislation I introduced and what else happened on Capitol Hill this week. If you would like to receive more frequent updates from me, you can follow me on Twitter , Facebook , and Instagram . As always, it is an honor to serve you. WHAT I'M WORKING ON On Tuesday, the President signed historic, long-overdue legal protections for Americans in same-sex and interracial marriages! The marriages of all of our family members, friends, and neighbors are now protected under federal law. On Wednesday, the U.S. House voted to pass a short-term agreement to fund the government. But we must not accept that narrowly avoiding a shutdown year after year is simply how it works. Congress must set aside partisan politics and sign a long-term agreement to fund critical services, protect the paychecks of federal employees, and keep the doors of our government open. Also on Wednesday, a bipartisan majority of the U.S. House passed legislation to provide federal funding to help law enforcement officers respond more effectively to Americans experiencing mental health, behavioral health, and substance use crises. We need to make sure that our first responders have all the tools and training they need to keep those in crisis and themselves safe. Virginia physicians and healthcare providers deserve support to contend with one of the largest surges of flu and RSV hospitalizations in the country. That is why I urged U.S. House and U.S. Senate leadership to prioritize relief for providers in the end-of-year government funding package. READ MORE FROM THE CULPEPER STAR-EXPONENT On Friday, I introduced bipartisan legislation to cut down on the wasteful spending and abuse of federal funds. Improper payments made by the government hurt the Americans who federal programs are intended to assist. We must work to better protect taxpayer dollars and the integrity of these programs. READ MORE We must ban Members of Congress from buying, trading, and selling individual stocks while serving the American people. For two and a half years, I have led the bipartisan TRUST in Congress Act to make that ban a reality. On Tuesday night, I was proud to join members of Virginia's African diaspora ahead of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. Virginia is home to one of the largest and most vibrant African diaspora communities in our country, and I know that a strong partnership between Africa and the United States is vital to accomplishing our shared goals. Our vibrant African diaspora strengthens our Commonwealth and our country. This week, the U.S. Senate passed a bill to recognize African Diaspora Heritage Month and the many contributions of the community - and I'm proud to lead this effort in the U.S. House. On Thursday, the U.S. House passed a bipartisan bill to give VA healthcare workers the same collective bargaining rights as private providers. The VA Employees Fairness Act would help the VA recruit the best healthcare workers to give our Veterans the care they deserve and have earned. Dreamers, DACA recipients, and those in the United States with Temporary Protected Status are American in every way except on paper. They have grown up and built lives for themselves in our country. They have started careers in management, education, sales, and construction. They have opened their own businesses. They have played an essential role in mitigating healthcare shortages. I am calling on U.S. Senate leadership to provide permanent protections and a pathway to citizenship for these talented and hardworking people.

Boosting American Competitiveness Christmas is going to look different for many Americans because of ongoing supply chain challenges and soaring inflation. We have seen shortages of items such as appliances, jewelry, electronics, holiday food items such as turkey, and even Christmas lights and trees. Faced with a serious hike in input costs, more than 70 percent of wholesale Christmas tree growers have been forced to increase their prices by up to 15 percent over last year. While supply fails to meet demand, record inflation is driving increases in the price of everyday essentials. Food costs are up over 10 percent from this time last year and energy costs are up 13 percent. According to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), inflation rose to 7.1 percent in November. When President Biden took office, inflation was just 1.4 percent. To strengthen domestic supply chains, fight inflation, and lower the cost of living for Americans, we must increase American production to meet demand and build and strengthen relationships with countries we can rely on. Boosting American competitiveness on the world stage with a strong, strategic trade strategy will help lower costs for both American families and producers who have seen fertilizer prices increase 30 percent in 2022, after increasing 80 percent in 2021. Enhancing our global competitiveness and leadership requires countering China's ambitions to maximize global influence in the developing world, especially Africa. This is why we need to be proactive in our relations with eager trade partners such as Kenya and Taiwan. With the eyes of the world on Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, China would like nothing more than to increase leverage over Taiwan. This would not only have implications for the electronics and semiconductor industry; it would increase the likelihood of conflict. China's zero COVID policy has already impacted the manufacturing plants that make iPhones. This has created waitlists for American consumers but, beyond that, our dependance on China is a serious national security issue. House Republicans are committed to holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable as part of our Commitment to America, which is why we are forming a Select Committee on China in the Republican-led Congress come January. To effectively counter China, we must prioritize homeshoring and nearshoring our supply chains and - as a member of the House Committee on Ways and Means - I look forward to working closely with the Select Committee on China. Expanding markets and lowering trade barriers for American manufacturers and producers whose products strengthen our economy must be among our top priorities in the new Congress. In addition, making the individual and small business provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including the 20 percent small business deduction, permanent will help ensure our businesses are truly competitive. Most importantly, it will provide much-needed relief for American consumers struggling under soaring inflation. It is clear one-party rule in Washington has failed American families and new leadership is long overdue. Through our Commitment to America, House Republicans will fight to get our country back on track. Help is on the way. Sincerely, Adrian Smith Member of Congress Rep.

483," Friend, We are in the business of customer service. Our team is dedicated to helping Iowans solve problems they have with the federal government. This year, we've closed over 2,500 constituent cases by helping people get back money they are owed by the IRS, collecting missing Social Security and veterans' benefits, and expediting passport cases to help people reunite with their families. I'm proud of the problems we've been able to solve for Iowans, so if you've run into a dead end or have any questions regarding federal agencies, please make sure you reach out to our team. For example, we've helped veterans schedule appointments at the local VA and recover lost VA benefits. When a constituent had her identity stolen, the IRS sent her a massive bill and she was unable to receive her Social Security payments. After we advocated on her behalf, the IRS withdrew their bill and she received the Social Security benefits she was owed. These are just a few ways our team has helped Iowans who felt like they had nowhere else to turn and were failed by the federal bureaucracy. If you're getting a dial-tone when trying to reach someone, don't know who to talk to about problem, or have any issue with a federal agency, we are here to answer your questions. There is no ask too small or challenge too big - we are here to serve, and we will leave no stone unturned to help.

I am proud to support the Agricultural Foreign Investment Transparency Act, legislation to strengthen our oversight of their malicious activity and help block China from buying another acre of U.S. farmland. We must take the threat posed by Communist China head on -- there is no time to waste. I'll continue working to hold Communist China accountable and to protect our national security. Bipartisan VA Same Day Scheduling Act We often hear from veterans who struggle to make appointments at the local VA. I'm cosponsoring the VA Same Day Scheduling Act, bipartisan legislation that will make it easier for veterans to schedule appointments at the VA and receive care in a timely manner. I will continue working across the aisle to ensure our veterans can receive the care they have earned. Poll: Children's Cold Medicine Shortage I've heard from parents who are worried about the current shortage of children's medications - from cold medicine to amoxicillin. Understandably, parents are increasingly concerned by these shortages with RSV and flu cases on the rise. This is on top of the ongoing baby formula shortage. Parents should have peace of mind that if they're going to the store for basic medications or baby formula for their kids, they're going to find it.

484," My work in TX-31 and Congress Dear Texan, It was a full week in Washington and Texas' 31st district, I wanted to take a moment to update you on my work in Congress and TX-31. ON THE DOCKET: Opening Two VA Clinics Continuing Resolution Secretary Mayorkas' Failures Saying Farewell to our 2022 Fellows THE BRIEF: The majority of adult Americans have reported experiencing financial hardship because of Bidenflation. Last week, Border Patrol agents reported facing 14,000 illegal crossings at our southern border in the span of just 48 hours. Electricity prices are expected to rise over 1 1% this winter. Representative Carter joins veterans, health care staff, and Central Texas Veterans Health Care System Director Michael Kiefer in cutting the ribbon for a new clinic in Copperas Cove. VA CLINICS OPEN FOR BUSINESS In 2019, I announced two new VA clinics coming to Killeen and Copperas Cove. After significant COVID delays, these two clinics are operational and veterans are getting care they need in a more accessible location. I heard from veterans in western Bell County that traveling to the Temple VA hospital often required long bus rides or full days off of work, so as the top Republican on the Veterans Affairs Subcommittee, I went to work years ago to find funding to open clinics in this area. It was fantastic to cut the ribbon on these two clinics today and see veterans come in to receive care. CONTINUING RESOLUTION While House Democrats approved a short-term funding bill to avoid a government shutdown, it failed to include Republican priorities to cut wasteful spending, reduce inflation, and prioritize border security and national defense. Texans deserve better! Congressman Carter joins Republican colleagues to discuss Mayorkas' failures at the border. SECRETARY MAYORKAS' ﻿ FAILURES Every day Texans are impacted by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas' failures at the southern border. Time and time again, he has chosen to allow chaos at the border resulting in Border Patrol agents, migrants, and Americans losing their lives. His inaction is a dereliction of duty. I stood alongside my Republican colleagues to send a clear message that Secretary Mayorkas must go and under a Republican majority, we will hold him accountable! I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU! Last week, the House passed a National Defense Authorization Act which included a provision that would roll back the vaccine mandate for service members. More than 8,000 active-duty service members were discharged for failure to obey a lawful order when they refused the vaccine. It is now being considered whether those discharged for not getting the vaccine should be reinstated. I want to know what you think. Take a moment to fill out the survey below. Do you believe that servicemembers discharged for not getting the vaccine should be reinstated? Yes No Representative Carter says goodbye to his 2022 legislative fellows. SAYING FAREWELL TO OUR 2022 FELLOWS Shareia and KD have served in my office as fellows assisting with military construction, veteran affairs, and defense legislation.

485," Advancing innovative climate solutions I'm Continuing My Work to Plan for our Climate Future December 17, 2022 Dear Friends, This year, I've been proud to lead House Democrats' efforts to deliver the most substantial action in history to combat the crisis of climate change. Our Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law in August, represents the largest investment in clean energy, environmental justice, and green jobs in American history. And as Chair of the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change, I was proud to author many of the climate provisions in this legislation, including measures that provide rebates for electrifying low- and moderate-income homes and a provision empowering new development in offshore wind technologies. But our work to drive clean energy advancements goes far beyond this single transformative bill. Over the past few months, I've joined with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce legislation that will build on the successes of the IRA to further advance innovative green energy solutions that address floating solar technology, clean hydrogen development, and community resilience. This October, I introduced the Community Mental Wellness & Resilience Act, a bipartisan bill that will tackle our nation's mental health crisis head-on by addressing the significant community trauma associated with natural disasters. Last year alone, more than 1 in 5 American adults experienced a diagnosed mental illness. And with more than 40 percent of Americans living in a county impacted by a major natural disaster in just the past year, it is growing clear that worsening severe weather patterns are a major contributor to this crisis. By providing new grants and partnerships with local, community-based initiatives that can craft locally specific approaches to prevent and heal mental health issues caused by disasters and other toxic stresses, this legislation will help communities across the nation better prepare for and respond to the growing challenges associated with climate change. I was thrilled that a Senate companion bill for this legislation was introduced just this week by Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts. Even as we work to reduce the harm natural disasters cause in our communities, we're also working toward greener energy solutions that will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and slow the effects of climate change. Earlier this month, I introduced the POWER our Reservoirs Act, a bill to direct key federal agencies to study opportunities to advance clean energy production and improve drought protection by deploying floating solar arrays on federal water reservoirs. According to a 2018 study, the use of such technology on the country's more than 24,000 human-made reservoirs could produce enough energy to meet 10 percent of our nation's electricity needs, all while reducing harmful evaporation that contributes to worsening droughts. This legislation, inspired by an innovative project I supported in the City of Cohoes, will protect our depleting water systems while expanding domestic renewable energy production - a significant victory both for our climate and for consumers. And last week, I joined Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma to introduce the Department of Energy Clean Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research, Development and Demonstration Act. This bipartisan legislation will empower the Department of Energy (DOE) to accelerate and strengthen its efforts to support the research and development of clean hydrogen and fuel cell technologies. Clean hydrogen energy provides us with an important pathway toward a more sustainable energy future. By providing critical federal support for projects to improve the durability of hydrogen fuel cells, optimize for clean hydrogen production in new electricity markets, and more, this bill will make certain that our nation is at the forefront of innovation in this crucial industry. Throughout my time in Congress, I've always worked to address our climate crisis from every angle. Even after the passage of the groundbreaking Inflation Reduction Act and its unprecedented clean energy investments, I've continued my efforts to boost renewable energy production here at home while also working to reduce the harmful effects of climate change, from historic droughts to community trauma. In the upcoming session of Congress, I'll continue to work tirelessly alongside my colleagues from both parties to help move our nation forward on the path to a cleaner, more sustainable future for all. As always, thank you for reading. Your friend, DID YOU KNOW?My office and I are working to ensure you remain informed with the latest updates and recommendations.

Our Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law in August, represents the largest investment in clean energy, environmental justice, and green jobs in American history . And as Chair of the Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change, I was proud to author many of the climate provisions in this legislation, including measures that provide rebates for electrifying low- and moderate-income homes and a provision empowering new development in offshore wind technologies. But our work to drive clean energy advancements goes far beyond this single transformative bill. Over the past few months, I've joined with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce legislation that will build on the successes of the IRA to further advance innovative green energy solutions that address floating solar technology, clean hydrogen development, and community resilience. This October, I introduced the Community Mental Wellness & Resilience Act , a bipartisan bill that will tackle our nation's mental health crisis head-on by addressing the significant community trauma associated with natural disasters . Last year alone, more than 1 in 5 American adults experienced a diagnosed mental illness. And with more than 40 percent of Americans living in a county impacted by a major natural disaster in just the past year, it is growing clear that worsening severe weather patterns are a major contributor to this crisis. By providing new grants and partnerships with local, community-based initiatives that can craft locally specific approaches to prevent and heal mental health issues caused by disasters and other toxic stresses, this legislation will help communities across the nation better prepare for and respond to the growing challenges associated with climate change. I was thrilled that a Senate companion bill for this legislation was introduced just this week by Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts. Even as we work to reduce the harm natural disasters cause in our communities, we're also working toward greener energy solutions that will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and slow the effects of climate change. Earlier this month, I introduced the POWER our Reservoirs Act , a bill to direct key federal agencies to study opportunities to advance clean energy production and improve drought protection by deploying floating solar arrays on federal water reservoirs. According to a 2018 study, the use of such technology on the country's more than 24,000 human-made reservoirs could produce enough energy to meet 10 percent of our nation's electricity needs , all while reducing harmful evaporation that contributes to worsening droughts. This legislation, inspired by an innovative project I supported in the City of Cohoes , will protect our depleting water systems while expanding domestic renewable energy production - a significant victory both for our climate and for consumers. And last week, I joined Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma to introduce the Department of Energy Clean Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research, Development and Demonstration Act . This bipartisan legislation will empower the Department of Energy (DOE) to accelerate and strengthen its efforts to support the research and development of clean hydrogen and fuel cell technologies . Clean hydrogen energy provides us with an important pathway toward a more sustainable energy future. By providing critical federal support for projects to improve the durability of hydrogen fuel cells, optimize for clean hydrogen production in new electricity markets, and more, this bill will make certain that our nation is at the forefront of innovation in this crucial industry. Throughout my time in Congress, I've always worked to address our climate crisis from every angle. Even after the passage of the groundbreaking Inflation Reduction Act and its unprecedented clean energy investments, I've continued my efforts to boost renewable energy production here at home while also working to reduce the harmful effects of climate change, from historic droughts to community trauma. In the upcoming session of Congress, I'll continue to work tirelessly alongside my colleagues from both parties to help move our nation forward on the path to a cleaner, more sustainable future for all. As always, thank you for reading. Your friend, DID YOU KNOW? My office and I are working to ensure you remain informed with the latest updates and recommendations.

As I've traveled that state, I've heard from countless Florida families about the pain it's causing them at home and in their businesses. That's why, as so-called leaders in Washington work in secret to pass yet another massive, multi-trillion dollar spending package that no one has had the opportunity to read, scrutinize or suggest changes to, I'm fighting to end the backroom dealing and stop more reckless spending of your tax dollars. With voters in Florida and across American choosing to put Republicans in power in the House of Representatives, it would be unthinkably foolish to give Nancy Pelosi a multitrillion-dollar gift right after she's been fired as House Speaker. I'm fighting to make sure Congress rejects the massive Pelosi-Schumer Spending Bill and instead passes a short-term funding bill to continue current government operations through the new year, allowing the new Republican-led House to do its part in writing a FULL, BALANCED budget. Washington has been broken and unaccountable for too long and Florida families can't afford another inflation-bomb spending bill. In 2018, you elected me to the United States Senate to make Washington work for Florida families and I've spent every day since working to protect your interests. I won't ever back down from that fight. Read more HERE. Sincerely, Rick Scott United States Senator To be the first to find out about Senator Scott's actions and statements, follow him on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram , and LinkedIn. - See more of what Senator Scott has been up to this week below. Sen. Rick Scott's Bipartisan END FENTANYL Act to Help Border Patrol Stop Drug Smuggling Unanimously Passes in Senate Senator Rick Scott's bipartisan legislation, the Eradicating Narcotic Drugs and Formulating Effective New Tools to Address National Yearly Losses of Life (END FENTANYL) Act, unanimously passed the Senate and heads to the House of Representatives where Congressmen Michael Guest and David Trone have introduced the House companion legislation. The END FENTANYL Act would require the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to update its policies at least once every three years to ensure operational field manuals, including their drug interdiction guidance, is up to date. This legislation builds off the 2019 GAO report, ""Land Ports of Entry: CBP Should Update Policies and Enhance Analysis of Inspections,"" that found drug interdiction guidance has not been updated in 20 years. This legislation is co-sponsored by Senators Mike Braun, Maggie Hassan, Dianne Feinstein and Jacky Rosen. Senator Rick Scott said, ""For too long, the crushing heartbreak felt from losing a loved one to a drug overdose, and the opioids that cause them, have plagued American families. This epidemic, fueled by the massive amounts of fentanyl flowing illegally over our southern border into our communities, has only grown worse. Every life taken by an accidental drug poisoning is a preventable tragedy and we must do everything in our power to stop them. We must continue our work to support our brave CBP agents, and all who are on the frontlines of this battle, ensuring they have every tool needed to fight back, keep these dangerous drugs out of our country and save lives. This is a big win in our fight against the lethal opioid epidemic, but it is not the end. I am thankful for my colleagues in the Senate voting for its passage, in addition to Congressmen Guest and Trone for leading this bipartisan charge in the House. I look forward to working together to get this important bill to the president's desk and signed into law."" Read more HERE. - Sen. Rick Scott, 10 Colleagues Urge Pentagon to Freeze COVID-19 Vaccine-Related Discharges, Reinstate Discharged Soldiers with Backpay Following the Senate's approval of the National Defense Authorization act (NDAA), Senator Rick Scott led his colleagues in a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. The Senators urged Secretary Austin to freeze all COVID-19 vaccine-related discharges, and to establish a quick and thorough process so all members who were discharged because they refused the COVID-19 vaccine can be reinstated with back pay and full benefits. Senators James Lankford, Mike Braun, John Hoeven, Jim Risch,   Graham, Mike Crapo, Mike Lee, Josh Hawley, Ron Johnson and Marco Rubio all co-signed the letter. Read the full letter HERE .

Rick Scott's Amendment to Stop IRS Spying, Expansion Senator Rick Scott secured a full vote of the United States Senate on his amendment to the week-long continuing resolution to stop the IRS from adding 87,000 new agents to audit families and small businesses. Senator Scott's amendment would also repeal a provision that allows the IRS to spy on every financial transaction of more than $600 made with Americans' bank accounts through vendors like CashApp, Venmo and PayPal. Although a bipartisan group, including all Senate Republicans, supported the amendment, Senate Democrats ultimately blocked its approval.

Rick Scott Applauds Unanimous Senate Passage of Bipartisan, Bicameral BOLIVAR Act; Calls for House Passage The Senate unanimously passed Senator Rick Scott's Banning Operations and Leases with the Illegitimate Venezuelan Authoritarian Regime (BOLIVAR) Act. The legislation would prohibit federal agencies from doing business with anyone that supports the oppressive Maduro regime. The bill had unanimously passed the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in March 2021. The BOLIVAR Act is co-sponsored by Senators Jacky Rosen, Marco Rubio and Thom Tillis. Congressman Michael Waltz and Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz are leading the companion bipartisan bill in the House of Representatives. In 2019, Senator Scott's amendment to cut off funds to the Maduro regime was included in the National Defense Authorization Act and Senator Scott signed similar legislation into law as Governor of Florida. Senator Rick Scott said, ""We all know what Nicolás Maduro is doing in Venezuela. He's starving his own citizens. He's imprisoning his political enemies. He's providing a foothold to Russia, Iran, Communist China and Hezbollah and is actively destabilizing our hemisphere. There is no reason the U.S. government should be working with companies that also work with such a gross dictator. I'm incredibly proud that the Senate voted to hold Maduro accountable for his abuses by unanimously passing my BOLIVAR Act. As we work to weaken Maduro's position in the Western Hemisphere, and oppose our enemies, such as Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, who support Maduro, this bill is a huge step forward and a big win for America's security. The passage of the BOLIVAR Act exemplifies the commitment of the American people to being tough with our enemies when they threaten America's national security. I'd like to thank my colleagues in the Senate and Representative Waltz for leading this effort in the House-we can and should pass this important bill into law NOW."" Read More HERE.

Rick Scott Celebrates NDAA Passage, Big Wins for Florida's Military Bases Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the U.S. Senate passed the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) . This year's NDAA includes $857.9 billion in defense spending, $45 billion more than President Joe Biden's inadequate budget request which did not keep up with his inflation crisis, and a rescission of the Pentagon's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for service members. Senator Scott continues to fight to ensure that service member who were unfairly discharged have the opportunity to be reinstated with backpay. Senator Rick Scott said, ""Florida is home to 21 military bases and three unified commands, and proud of the important and strategic role we play in America's national defense. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I fought hard this year to make sure the Sunshine State, America's national security initiatives, our military, veterans and their families got big wins in this NDAA. Since coming to the Senate four years ago, I've consistently advocated for major investments in our defense capabilities and to support Florida's military bases and our military families. The NDAA that passed the Senate today is a huge improvement over President Biden's woefully inadequate defense budget proposal and a great win for Florida, America's national security and our military community, but there is still work to do. While I'm glad this NDAA rescinds the Pentagon's COVID-19 vaccine mandate, I will continue to fight so that every service member who was wrongfully discharged has the opportunity to be reinstated with backpay.""

Rick Scott on CPI Report: Short-Term CR is Necessary to Stop More Reckless Spending Following the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Senator Rick Scott released the below statement highlighting the need to implement substantive fiscal reforms to end the ongoing inflation crisis fueled by the Biden administration's reckless tax-and-spend agenda. November's CPI data shows that there has been significant inflation nearly every month of Biden's presidency, increasing 7.1% in November. The 7.1% increase reported for November 2022 is on top of the 6.8% increase reported for November 2021. That means that since Biden's election, inflation has jumped 13.9%. With government funding expiring on Friday, December 16, Senator Scott, along with Senators Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), wrote a letter expressing strong opposition to passing the Pelosi-Schumer omnibus spending bill, which would continue authorization for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to use $80 BILLION of taxpayer money to hire 87,000 new agents. The senators also called on their Republican colleagues in the Senate to support a short-term Continuing Resolution (CR) which simply extends current funding levels until the 118th Congress begins with a new Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Senator Rick Scott said, ""As inflation continues to rage and make life harder for American families, Washington Democrats are doubling down on their plans for even more reckless spending and a bigger IRS to snoop on your finances. The Pelosi-Schumer Spending Bill is not just a reckless inflation bomb, it also advances dangerous federal overreach that will impact the lives of nearly every hardworking American and business owner. Since we won't be putting together a balanced budget in the next few days, the next best thing is a CR that rejects any new reckless spending. When the new Congress convenes in January, Republicans in the Senate, along with a new Republican majority in the House, can begin the important work of building a real, balanced budget, repealing Biden's 87,000 agent IRS army and its insane $600 transaction reporting threshold, and getting America's finances back in order. It's time to stop caving to Democrats and stand up for what the American people want in Washington: less government, less spending and more accountability. That's what I'm fighting for and I won't stop until we get it done."" Read more HERE. - VIDEO RELEASE Sen. Rick Scott on Senate Floor: Americans Have Had Enough of Washington's Dysfunctional Spending Senator Rick Scott spoke on the Senate floor in support of Senator Ron Johnson's request to unanimously pass a clean continuing resolution (CR) that would keep the government funded through February 4th, 2023, after Republicans have taken the majority in the House of Representatives. This is the latest action taken over the past several months to support the passage of a CR until after the start of the 118th Congress. Read more HERE.

Rick Scott and Ron Johnson Urge GAO to Report Potential Risks in Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Senators Rick Scott and Ron Johnson sent a letter to Gene Dodaro, Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), requesting an audit of health care services to members of the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program. Following audits to Medicare and VA health programs, GAO uncovered potential fraud through improper payments causing an increase in the cost of the program and putting those in need of care at risk for seeing providers that may have had suspended medical licenses. As the largest employer-sponsored health insurance program in the country, the FEHB Program covers more than eight million federal employees, retirees and family members at annual cost of more than $59 billion.

Rick Scott & Tom Cotton Introduce Bill to Cut Huawei and Chinese 5G Companies off from U.S. Banks Senators Rick Scott, Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and Mike Lee (R-Utah) sent a letter expressing opposition to passing the Pelosi-Schumer omnibus spending bill in the current lame duck Congress. The senators wrote, ""The American people sent an unmistakable message in the November midterm elections, making clear that they want a Republican-led House to serve as check on the unfettered spending of the current Democrat-controlled Congress. For the Senate to ram through a so-called 'omnibus' bill-which would fund the entirety of the Pelosi-Schumer spending agenda through most of next year-would utterly disempower the new Republican House from enacting our shared priorities. Locking the new Congress into yet another year of Democrat policies would flout the will of the voters and prevent the incoming Republican majority in the House of Representatives and the newly elected Republican Senators from moderating the reckless policy agenda of the last two years. Moreover, adding an increase or suspension of the debt ceiling for another year would issue Democrats a blank check and inevitably add trillions more to our crushing national debt.""

Rick Scott to Social Media Execs: Congress Will Hold You Accountable for Censoring Speech & Lying Under Oath Senator Rick Scott sent letters to leaders of social media companies Meta, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube demanding answers regarding the extent of their knowledge of the platforms' censorship. Earlier this year in a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee hearing, the executives testified under oath their respective companies were not shadow banning or manipulating news feeds to censor speech. Recent reports, such as Twitter Files, have shown this testimony to be at a minimum misleading, and potentially false. In his letter, Senator Scott makes clear that if social media executives lied under oath, they must be held accountable. Read the full letters HERE . - Sen. Rick Scott & Colleagues Warn FBI Against Politically-Charged Investigation of Israel Defense Forces Senator Rick Scott led a press conference with Senators Rand Paul, Mike Lee and Mike Braun to discuss the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and to call for a short-term continuing resolution (CR) to fund the government until shortly after the 118th Congress begins. Rear Admiral Pete Brown (retired), former Commander of the Coast Guard's Seventh District, was also present to discuss the Biden administration's decision to dishonorably discharge members of our armed services who refused to take the COVID-19 vaccine.

Rick Scott Issues Weekly Update on Biden's Inflation Crisis Senator Rick Scott released a weekly update on his actions to address America's debt crisis and rising inflation. Since being elected to the U.S. Senate, Senator Scott has urged government accountability to the American taxpayer. Ahead of Friday's government funding deadline and following this week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Senator Scott released the following statement: As inflation continues to rage and make life harder for American families, Washington Democrats are doubling down on their plans for even more reckless spending and a bigger IRS to snoop on your finances.

Rick Scott and Mike Lee in Fox News: US can't afford Pelosi-Schumer spending bomb: We demand continuing resolution until new Congress as Congress considers spending bills ahead of government funding expiring on Friday, December 16, Senators Rick Scott and Mike Lee wrote an op-ed for Fox News demanding the passage of a clean continuing resolution (CR) that extends government funding until after the new Congress begins in 2023. Their newly published op-ed echoes their sentiments from earlier this year expressed in both a previous op-ed and a letter stressing the need for Republicans to unite behind a clean government funding bill that simply maintains current federal spending bills until a new Congress begins in January 2023. In their new op-ed , the Senators wrote, ""Back in September, we wrote in these pages about our disgust with reckless spending in Washington and the historic inflation it was forcing on American families. In that Op-Ed, we made clear that for the spending to stop, Republicans must unite in opposing another spending bill and demand that we pass a continuing resolution (CR) that simply maintains current federal spending levels-and not a penny more-until a new Congress begins. Now, with the government funding deadline just days away and the start of a new Republican majority in the House coming in mere weeks, we again demand fiscal responsibility and urge our colleagues to stand strong in opposing the Pelosi-Schumer spending bill … For nearly two years, we've seen the devastating impact of total Democrat control in Washington and heard from countless families in our states about the pain it's causing them at home and in their businesses. That's why the American people sent an unmistakable message in the November midterm elections, making clear that they want a Republican-led House to serve as a check on the unfettered spending of the current Democrat-controlled Congress … To understand why, let's reflect for a moment on what the last two years of total Democrat control in Washington have delivered to hardworking families: The national debt has grown by nearly $5 TRILLION to an insane $31 TRILLION, causing record inflation that is nearly four times higher than the Federal Reserve target of 2%. … …Washington Democrats have worked to raise taxes on nearly every American while recklessly spending $80 BILLION so the IRS can hire 87,000 new agents to target working families and small businesses. Worse still, Democrats are now forcing every American to report any transaction of $600 or more to the IRS, giving the federal government unprecedented access into the personal finances of American families. And there is a historically uncontrolled humanitarian and national security crisis on America's southern border due to Biden's radical open border and pro-amnesty policies… Given these Democrat ""achievements,"" it would be a blatant dereliction of our duty for Senate Republicans to allow Chuck Schumer to ram through a so-called ""omnibus"" bill… In fact, since 1954, control of the House has changed five times and there has NEVER been an instance of Congress passing an omnibus spending bill before a new House majority takes power … It's time for Republicans to stand together and force Democrats to compromise. We cannot cave and give Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , a multitrillion-dollar gift right after she's been fired as speaker of the House. To ignore the clear results of the recent election by locking in and fully funding the Pelosi-Schumer spending agenda just weeks before the new Congress begins would be an unforgivable betrayal of the will of American voters …"" Read the full op-ed in Fox News HERE. - Fox News: Rick Scott urges McConnell to respect House incoming GOP majority and tank yearlong budget deal Wall Street Journal: Will the Republican Party Find Its Way Again?

488," News from Representative Steil December 16, 2022 Kicking the Can Down the Road Friend, Congress has a spending problem. In Fiscal Year 2022, the government spent over $6 trillion dollars with a $1.3 trillion deficit. Government spending was set to expire tonight. Yesterday, Congress passed a one week continuing resolution to continue negotiations. We should not be in a situation where we are funding the government for a week at a time. Each year, the lack of an open and transparent budget process leads to more irresponsible spending. If we continue to fund the government at its current levels, our nation's defense and critical government programs are threatened. Washington has yet again kicked the can down the road to avoid our critical responsibility to fund the government. I'll be continuing to fight for funding that appropriately funds our government, cuts wasteful spending, and puts our country on the right track. Questioning FTX CEO Earlier this week, the current CEO of FTX testified before the Financial Services Committee regarding the fraud of the previous CEO Sam Bankman Fried. I've had a lot of questions about the collapse of this major company that has resulted in millions of Americans getting hurt. During the questioning, Mr. Ray revealed the Bahamian authorities ""pushback"" when asked for transparency has been ""extraordinary, irregular, and raises questions."" His comments indicated that Bahamian authorities appear to have taken money that could have been used to repay American families who lost funds. My takeaway from the hearing: there are more questions that need to be asked. Too many Americans had money stolen from them. For too long, Congress has been asleep at the wheel and has failed to create a roadmap for cryptocurrencies. Now, we're seeing the fallout, as innocent Americans have now lost billions of dollars. I'll be continuing to ask questions to get the answers we all need. We must prevent another FTX collapse from ever occurring.

490," 874 WORDS | 6.2 MINUTE READ Hi  , As 2022 comes to a close, I'm reflecting on the exceptional progress we've made - and I hope there's even more to come before we ring in the New Year! In the past week alone, we passed a bipartisan defense package that included several provisions I authored and officially made love the law by codifying marriage equality. Read on for more on this and my continued efforts to support employee-owned businesses too: Delivering For Our Community and Nation Congress passed the annual defense spending package, known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), with broad bipartisan support last week. I'm pleased to report that several amendments I authored were in the final bill, including measures to support U.S. efforts to bring a World Expo to Bloomington and to enhance electronic medical recordkeeping for the families of our veterans - but the one of which I'm most proud was inspired by a remarkable Minnesota family who turned tragedy into lifesaving action. I was honored to have Dan Schink in Washington to see the passage of the Aqua Alert Act. Watch his family's story here. One day before Valentine's Day last year, Minnesota resident David Schink set out in a kayak off the coast of Florida and never returned. Once they realized he was missing, David's son Dan, his wife Judy, and the entire Schink family alerted the Coast Guard and local authorities, but they lacked sufficient resources and capabilities to locate David and bring him home safely. That's when the Schink family realized that search and rescue missions in coastal regions and on major waterways were not taking advantage of an important resource: the many recreational boaters, kayakers, beach goers, and other people who live on or near the water and could assist the Coast Guard and other first responders when someone goes missing. The Schinks soon turned the pain of their loss into action in the hopes of preventing a tragedy like David's disappearance from happening to another family, reaching out to me and my office to share their ideas. Following their advocacy, I introduced the Aqua Alert Act to require the Coast Guard to establish a pilot program for AMBER Alert-style messages to facilitate public cooperation in aiding and rescuing distressed individuals on the water. It passed as part of the national defense bill last week, with Dan watching in the House Gallery . Protecting Marriage Equality Every person in the United States is entitled to the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. With fundamental freedoms at risk of infringement by the Supreme Court, it falls to elected leaders to ensure that the law guarantees equal protection for all Americans - including when it comes to the freedom to marry. That's why I was so proud to cosponsor, vote for, and help pass the Respect for Marriage Act last week. This new law repeals the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) entirely, which had defined marriage for federal purposes as the union of one man and one woman and allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages granted under the laws of other states. The Respect for Marriage Act enshrines marriage equality for same-sex and interracial couples for purposes of federal law and will provide them additional legal protections. This historic achievement was built on decades of advocacy, and I honor all those who made it possible. Empowering Employee Owned Businesses As Chairman of the Small Business Oversight, Investigations and Regulations Subcommittee - and a longtime business owner myself - I'm on a mission to ensure America's small businesses are in a position to innovate and grow. Last week, I ​convened ​a hearing to examine the challenges employee-owned businesses, including those with Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), face when trying to access U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) lending programs. Watch me promote compassionate capitalism through employee stock ownership programs (ESOPs). Minnesota is home to 265 employee-owned businesses, the most per capita of any state. In many cases, workers at these businesses boast higher pay, greater job security, and better benefits, including higher retirement savings. Given the long list of benefits associated with this model, it's vital we ensure these businesses have equal access to the federal initiatives meant to support small businesses. Cooperatives and ESOPs are a part of Minnesota's legacy, and I've had the privilege of spending time with many of them right here in our community . These visits provide me with the stories and information I need to better support the businesses who wish to do good in addition to doing well, and I will continue advocating for them in Washington, DC. Keep in touch, and keep the faith, Dean Phillips Member of Congress Bill of the Week ✔️ H.R. 3648, the Equal Access to Green cards for Legal Employment (EAGLE) Act of 2022 Our immigration system is woefully outdated, inefficient, and in need of fundamental reform. I support streamlining and modernizing our immigration laws in order to afford hardworking immigrants a fair pathway to citizenship and opportunity to live the American Dream. That's why I'm a proud cosponsor of H.R. 3648, the Equal Access to Green cards for Legal Employment (EAGLE) Act of 2022 . This bipartisan bill modifies requirements related to employment-based visas. Instead of allocating employment visas by country, the EAGLE Act increases family-based immigrant visas, and establishes rules for employment visas. In particular, the bill prioritizes workers with advanced degrees and other skilled workers, and reserving visas for physical therapists and professional nurses.

491," Congressman Simpson's Update December 16th, 2022 Floor Schedule | Committee Activity Congressman Simpson's UpdateDecember 16, 2022 Christmas Dinner Will Be More Expensive if the Senate Doesn't Act Now Floor Schedule | Committee Activity Congressman Simpson's Update December 16, 2022 Christmas Dinner Will Be More Expensive if the Senate Doesn't Act Now As the year comes to an end, Idaho families keep telling me how weary they are of inflation and food bills that keep going up. It seems that every time we go to the grocery store, the price of milk, orange juice, and other staples is higher than it was the last time we were there. But Idaho farmers know that worse things will come in the new year if we don't do something quickly to prevent significant labor cost increases for those who put food on our tables. Agriculture faces a growing workforce crisis, and if Congress doesn't act, all Americans will feel the painful impact. Last month, the Department of Agriculture released data gathered in its quarterly Farm Labor Survey. The Department of Labor uses this data to determine mandatory wages under the H-2A temporary visa program, which farmers use to find seasonal farm workers. According to this year's data, farmers will face an unprecedented and significant increase in labor costs for 2023. This comes at a time when Idaho's farmers already struggle with higher input costs and significant labor shortages. As production costs get higher and higher, more farms risk going out of business. And if we think record inflation has punished Americans' pocketbooks, a failure to solve this issue will only bring more pain at the grocery store. Time for debating this issue has run out, but luckily the pieces are already in place to solve the problem. For several years, I've worked with a coalition of Idaho producers and others to find a legislative solution to the critical workforce shortage that is crippling the American agriculture industry. The product of this collaborative work is the Farm Workforce Modernization Act (FWMA) , which passed the House with bipartisan support last year. This bill offers comprehensive solutions to the complex workforce problems facing agriculture. It reforms the costly and cumbersome H-2A guestworker program to ensure that farmers can get the workers they need. This includes opening the program to non-seasonal agriculture work, like dairy, so that dairy producers can find the workers they need to milk their cows every day, regardless of the season. It tackles the long-standing challenge of providing a stable, legal agriculture workforce by bringing the millions of undocumented farm workers in the U.S. out from the shadows of our immigration system so they can get right with the law. And, especially important at this moment, it provides a federal legislative fix to immediately stabilize agriculture wages. Because immigration has become such a hot-button issue in this country, many politicians refuse to tackle these challenges out of fear of political fall-out. This is irresponsible and unacceptable. Make no mistake: we must do something to address the border crisis in this country, and I have been a strong advocate for securing our borders since I was elected to Congress. But this is not a border security problem; it is a food supply issue, and it is quickly becoming a huge crisis. The American people want their elected officials to have the political courage to tackle these problems, not just hone their political brands at the expense of making needed change. In crafting the FWMA, we've done the hard work of listening to stakeholders and hammering out common-sense solutions to these challenges. By crafting a thoughtful compromise, we've found a solution that has the support of over 250 agriculture industry groups. Now the Senate just needs to act by passing the FWMA. Doing so would provide needed stability for American agriculture, give economic relief to American families, and serve as a model for long-overdue larger immigration reforms for which the American people have been calling for decades. Protecting Our Water Resources Idaho is home to one of the most unique water systems in the world in the Snake River and Snake River Plain aquifer. This system is also one of the most precious resources for our state as the agriculture industry relies on the ground and surface water it supplies. Thanks to KTVB for highlighting this important story. Find it HERE . Read More Celebrating the National Guard On December 13, the U.S. National Guard celebrated 386 years since it's found in 1636. This week, Idaho also welcomed home soldiers for the Idaho Army National Guard's State Aviation Group . They served valiantly for nine months supporting Operation Enduring Freedom in the AFRICOM Area of Responsibility.

492," News from Congressman Brian Mast 5 YEARS AGO WE PASSED HISTORIC TAX REFORM   - Five years ago, I had just been sworn in as your Representative, and together with the House Republican Majority and President Donald Trump, we worked to improve the lives of those we represented. That's why the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was our top priority. Passing historic tax reform let small businesses reinvest in their workers and their companies. It let families keep more of their hard-earned money and it led to the strongest economy in decades. We did what we said we would do: we cut taxes and created jobs. Unfortunately, the current Democrat Majority has taken the opposite approach. Their bill, the Inflation ""Reduction"" Act, has increased inflation. It's time to get back to what works and let our economy thrive again. WATCH NOW To learn more about my work on your behalf, please visit my website .

497," Can't see the pictures? Select ""Always display images"" or Click here to open in browser . Securing Our Future A Safer World For Our Children Ten years ago, Newtown and our entire nation were shaken by an unfathomable act of evil: twenty precious schoolchildren and six devoted educators slaughtered at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Words cannot capture the agony and outrage of this monstrous rampage, which robbed innocent children of their futures and left their loved ones forever shattered. Tragically, these wounds were again reopened earlier this year by the elementary school massacre in Uvalde - a brutal reminder that, a decade later, a gun violence crisis continues to steal our precious children. Endlessly inspired by courageous survivors and families transforming their anguish into action, House Democrats have led the charge to combat the scourge of gun violence. This summer, President Biden and the Democratic Congress enacted the first major gun violence prevention law in nearly three decades, which deploys stronger tools to keep weapons out of dangerous hands and invests in critical mental health services. More must be done to save lives - which is why the Democratic House has passed legislation to reinstate the Assault Weapons Ban, more efficiently warn communities during an active shooting and finally secure universal background checks. We will not rest until these vital measures become law. As we reflect on the decade since Newtown, let us reaffirm our resolve to stop the bloodshed and build a safer world for our children. Leading On Climate Seven years ago this week, the global community gathered in Paris, united by a shared commitment to saving our planet. The Paris Climate Agreement charted a roadmap toward unprecedented climate action, setting ambitious targets in our fight against an existential crisis. Last month, I had the privilege of leading a Congressional delegation to COP27 in Egypt, where the United States and our partners proudly reaffirmed our pledge to forge a healthier, safer and more sustainable future. Committed to ensuring America leads that global effort - and inspired by tireless activists across the country - House Democrats proudly delivered the largest climate investment in history. Our Inflation Reduction Act includes historic environmental investments: Slashing carbon pollution by 40 percent before 2030. Lowering energy costs by investing in energy efficient homes, vehicles and appliances. Strengthening energy security by bringing clean energy manufacturing to American shores and creating millions of good-paying jobs. Decarbonizing our economy, substantially reducing pollution from electricity production, transportation, industrial manufacturing, buildings and agriculture. Investing more than $60 billion in environmental justice priorities to ensure that underserved communities share in the benefits of our transition to a clean economy. As I told our allies at COP27, each of us has a moral responsibility to our children - to ensure they have clean air to breathe, clean water to drink and a healthy planet to call home. Today, and every day, let us renew our resolve to honor that sacred obligation. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi and her husband Paul Pelosi unveil her portrait in Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol.

498," News from Representative DeGette ABOUT DIANA SERVICES ISSUES NEWSROOM STUDENTS CONTACT ME Dear Friend, It has been nearly one month since the horrific events that unfolded at the Club Q nightclub in Colorado Springs, where a shooter - armed with a semiautomatic assault weapon and high-capacity magazine - entered the popular LGBTQ+ club and opened fire, killing five people and injuring at least 22 more. No one should have to experience the unimaginable pain and suffering that so many in our community are still feeling in the wake of this tragedy. And no one should have to live in constant fear of suddenly being attacked for who they are or who they love. This week, I led a resolution on the House floor honoring the victims of this tragedy and calling for an end to the hate-filled rhetoric that's fueling an increase in violent threats against the LGBTQ+ community. The toxic combination of hate and access to guns continues to produce deadly results in this country. And, at some point, we, as a society, must come together and declare 'enough is enough.' Every member of the LGBTQ+ community deserves to live their life openly without fear of hate and violence. Neither the anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric that's fueling these awful attacks, or the weapons of war being used to carry them out, should have any place in our society. In calling for an end to the hateful rhetoric demonizing the LGBTQ+ community, I'm also urging my colleagues to pass the commonsense gun safety measures that we all know will help keep our communities safe from the constant threat of gun violence that we face. We need to ban the sale of high-capacity magazines in this country, which are being used to make these tragedies so much more deadly, and we need to get these assault weapons off of our streets once and for all. As we continue to mourn this horrific attack, it's important to remember that the best antidote to hate is love. And this was a historic week in our fight to ensure love always wins. By signing the Respect for Marriage Act into law, President Biden officially made marriage equality the law of our land. Now, every same-sex and interracial couple in this country has a federal right to marry who they love - regardless of where they live. And I couldn't think of a more fitting way to bring this tumultuous year to a close. As always, if you have any questions about these or any other issue, please call my office at 303-844-4988, or visit my website at where you can learn more about how my staff is available to assist you.
